Moreover, EDMS provides a more compact means of storage, universal 	\naccess for retrieval, and higher levels of data security and privacy.	 	\n 	The process of EDMS has to do with capturing, storing, indexing and retrieval. 	\nit improves the accessing of informatio	n by the users of the organization wherein they 	\ncan  easily  search  and  retrieve  the  documents  needed.  Also,  there will  be  security  in \nsuch  a  way  that  the  only  authorized  users  are  allowed  to  access  the  particular \ndocuments. 	 	\n \nProject Context	 	\n 	Central  Mindan	ao  University 	– Research  office  is  responsible 	for  signing  of 	\nthesis/dissertation,  thesis  manuscripts,  routinely  requests  and  advising  on  research \nstatistics/data  analysis.  Services  made  by  the  office  is  done  manually,  daily \ntransactions  are  written  or  enc	oded  and  stored  in  one  place  which  cause  them 	\ndifficulties in tracking information or data in a specific date. 	 	\n \nPurpose and Description	 	\n 	Developing  an  EDMS  would  make  the	 Research  office  services  more 	\npresentable and convenient. With this, the developer will work to create an EDMS that \nwill save and manage the student’s manuscripts.	 The web application will be expected 	\nto give users a new experience in interacting with the	 said EDMS.	 	\n 	The development of such web application will help users look for the research 	\nmaterials they’re lookin	g. Transactions will be done through online from uploading of 	\nmanuscripts and searching for possible research material. The web application w	ill be 	\neasy to use and accessible to all users.\n\n2 	\n \nObjectives of the Project	 	\n 	The  general	 objective	 of  this  project  is  to  design,  develop  and  implement  an 	\nElectronic Document Management System for Central Mindanao University Research \nOffice.	 	\n 	Specifically, t	he study aims to:	 	\n1. design a	nd create a	 database structure for record repository;	 	\n2. design a	nd create a	 website that is accessible and easy to use;	 	\n3. design and develop a web	-based application for document management;	 	\n4. allo	w uploading of documents online;	 	\n5. automatically 	assign categories and tags to uploaded documents;	 	\n6. employ barcode for tracking hardcopy of documents.	 	\n \nSignificance of the Study	 	\n 	The  significance  of  the  web	-based  application	 (EDMS)	 will  be  to  offer  great 	\nconvenience to the student’s submitting their manuscript. It giv	es them lesser amount 	\nof  effort,	 conserve  their  time  and  energy	 by  letting  them  upload  their  manuscript 	\nanywhere  they  want	. As  for  the  admin  side  it  will  hasten  the  sea	rch  of  research 	\nmaterials 	since	 all  the manuscripts  uploaded are  cat	egorize/segregated accordingly	, 	\nalso with the use of barcode they will be able to track the documents barrowed.	 	\n 	With the use of EDMS it will help reduce overhead of staff time and	 acceler	ate 	\nflow of information since everything is done electronically.	 EDMS will provide	 a more 	\ncompact means of storage	 and higher levels of data security and privacy.\n\n3 	\n \nConceptual Framework	 	\n 	\nFigure 1	: Conceptual Paradigm	 	\n 	\n 	Figure 1 shows the conceptual 	paradigm in developing an Electronic Document 	\nManagement System. Those who	 will	 access the website will be directed to the server 	\nwhich is connected to the database locally and all the data provided in the file system \nwill  be  viewed.  With  this,  all 	operati	on  will  be  made  easy  from  the  user  up  until  the 	\nadministrator’s side.	 	\n \nScope and Limitations of the project	  	\n 	The EDMS will be intended to the users to upload and inquire for manuscripts. 	\nIt will have the ability to search for keyword(s) inside the 	manuscript and return the title 	\nand abstract containing the keyword(s). The users of the system can be anybody as \nlong  as  registered  in  the  website.  All  details  on  the  website  will  be  provided  by  the \nadministrator on the server side.	 	\n 	The users must 	have a	n account in the website in order to search for research 	\nmaterials. 	The EDMS will employ a search	-engine style of searching for not only exact 	\nmatches but for relevant documents as well. 	Only the title and abstract will be provided 	\nto  the  users,  obtaining 	the  whole  manuscript  will  need  to  have  the  author’s 	\nauthorization.  There  will  be  no  downloading  involved  during  the  whole  process,  all \nmanuscripts or research material must be claimed at the CMU Research office along \nwith the authorization of the author.	 The hard copy of the manuscript will be provided\n\n4 	\n \nwith  a 	barcode;	 the  barcode  will  be	 scanned  by  a  barcode  scanner 	in  order  to 	\ndetermine if the manuscript is being barrowed or is within the Research office.	 On the 	\nuploading  of  manuscripts,  the  student  must  b	e  a  bona  fide  student  of  Central 	\nMindanao  University  and  must  have  completed  all  the  requirements  needed. 	When 	\nuploading the manuscript, the EDMS will automatically assign categories and tags for \nlesser human error.	 	\n 	Statistical  data  will  also  be  displayed	 by  the  web	-application,  this  will  include 	\nstatistical data of student’s course, college, study, and field.	 	\nThe student’s account will b	e coming from the existing data	base	 to access the 	\nwebsite. The existing database will be used by the researcher to develop the EDMS.	 	\nThe  manuscript’s  must  be  in  portable  document  format(PDF)  in  order  for  it  to 	\nbe uploaded.	 Checking of manuscript content for plagiarism will not be included i	n this 	\nstudy.\n\n5 	\n 	\nCHAPTER II	 	\nREVIEW OF RELATED LITERATURE	 	\n  	\nIn  common  language  the  word  document  usually  means  a  container  of 	\ninformation (usually on paper) containing written or drawn information for a particular \npurpose in structured way. Traditionally, a	 document is a piece of paper or a collection 	\nof papers, for instance, a memo, a letter, a mission statement or a customer invoice. \nCentral  to  the  idea  of  a  document  is  usually  that  it  can  be  easily  transferred,  stored \nand  handled  as  a  unit.  Over  the  last 	decade,  the  term  document  has  undergone  a 	\nradical  change  in  definition.  This  change  is partly  due  to  IT.  Thus  a  large  part  of  the \ndocuments handled in today’s business world are stored as individual computer files \nand  are  treaded  as  units  by  the  operating 	and  email  system	 (Life  Cycle  Document 	\nManagement System for Construction, n.d.)	 	\nWeb  application  usability  is  an  evolving  issue.  As  we  learn  more  and  more 	\nabout how our users interact with web application, how our users retrieve i	nformation 	\nand  use  it,  what  our  users  anticipate  within  their  realm  of  experiences,  we  can \niteratively improve our design and implementation	 (Wang, 2006)	. 	\nA  portal is a  system  that  serves  as  a  centralized  place  for accessing  d	ifferent 	\nresources in the Web (Atlantic Webfitters, 2014). It gathers information from different \nsources and put it all together in a single place which can help in accessing information \nby  several  users.  It  provides  the  users  with  a  single  point  of  conten	t,  data,  and 	\nservices. It can be personalized depending on the role of the user in the organization \n(Eldrandaly, 2009). There are different types of portal: general, community, horizontal, \nvertical,  enterprise,  personal,  and  niche.  Community  Portal  is  a  sy	stem  where  the 	\nusers are of same group of interests (Tatnall, 2005). 	 	\nElectronic document management solutions are designed to organize business 	\nfiles  and  records  digitally,  whether  they  started  out  in  paper form  or were  generated \nby  software  applications.	 Paper  files  are  first  converted  to  electronic  format  by 	\nscanning.  This  provides  a  more  compact  means  of  storage,  universal  access  for \nretrieval, and higher levels of data security and privacy	 (Easy Document Management: 	\nA Guide to B	enefits, Features, and Selection, 2011)	.\n\n6 	\n 	\nCodeigniter Development is one of the best PHP framework in web Application 	\nDevelopment. If a developer wished to develop an application in a better way, then the \nonly  option  is  web  development  with  framework.  As  compared  to  the  other \nframeworks,  Codeignit	er  Development  is  fast  and  reliable.  Its  time  and  speed  are 	\nsignificant.  The  developer  can  modify  (software)  for  use  on  a  different  machine  or \nplatform  for  existing  codes  by  using  PHP  framework.  PHP  server  side  scripting \nlanguage  is  very  useful,  In  PHP  sof	tware  development,  PHP  programming  or  PHP 	\napplication  development  or  outsourcing  PHP  is  used 	(What  is  Codeigniter  and  its 	\nadvantages, 2014)	. 	\nThere  are  a  lot  of  benefits  the  codeigniter framework can  offer. Aside from  its 	\nfast, 	reliable, lightweight and more capability. PHP helps in fixing errors on the system 	\neasily.  Through  this  framework,  developer  can  achieve  the  desired  specification  on \nthe developed system. Codeigniter Development can extend on PHP coding to get the \nspecifi	c functions through frameworks. In web Development, many features are almost 	\nthe  same  so  that  can  describe  the  same  code  in  different  way.  Codeigniter  PHP \nDevelopment is the easiest way to employ a program. It is compatible with most web \nservers,  numerous 	operating  systems  and  platforms.  This  framework  has  an 	\noutstanding  performance  and  it  is  famous  among  developer  especially  on  web \ndeveloping	 (Major  Benefits  of  Using  Codeigniter  PHP  Framework  Development, 	\n2016)	. \nPHP	 is one of 	the most popularly used languages for	 web development	 as well 	\nas	 web application development	. Reasons are 	it has 	Perfect Database Interaction:	  it 	\ncan  exchange  all  sorts  of  information  with  ease.  Another  reason  why	 PHP 	website 	\ndevelopment	 and	 web  developme	nt is  admired  by  developers  is  that	 PHP	 programs 	\nare free. Also, the database connectivity is less expensive as compared to that of other \nprograms  such  as  ASP  and  a  Microsoft  product  that  needs  to  be  purchased. \nHowever,	 web development with PHP	 through MyS	QL is free to use.	 PHP	 has also an 	\nupper hand when it comes to speed. This is mainly because, the	 PHP	 code runs faster 	\nas it runs in its own memory space	 (How is PHP used in Web Development, n.d.)	.\n\n7 	\n 	\nCHAPTER III	 	\nTECHNICAL 	BACKGROUND	 	\n \n HTML	 	\n 	Hypertext Mark	-up Language (	HTML) is a computer language devised to allow 	\nwebsite  creation.  These  websites  can  then  be  viewed  by  anyone  else  connected  to \nthe  internet.  It  is  relatively  easy  to  learn,  with  the  basics  being  accessible  to  m	ost 	\npeople in one session and it is quite powerful in what it allows the developer to create. \nIn  developing  a  website  HTML  is  handy.  HTML  codes  are  also  accessible  when  it \ncomes  to  the  coding  process  because  it  can  be  edited  through  Sublime  Text, \nProgramme	rs  Notepad  or  just  simply  a  notepad  editor.  Aside  that  it  helps  on  giving 	\nfunctionalities  on  the  program,  it  is  also  one  of  the  reason  why  designing  became \neasier 	(Shannon, 2012)	. 	\nPHP	 	 	\n 	PHP  Hypertext  Preprocessor  (PHP)  is  a 	widely	-used  open  source  general	-	\npurpose scripting language that is especially suited for web development and can be \nembedded  into  HTML.  PHP  is  also  a  powerful  tool  in  developing  an  interactive  and \ndynamic web page. The code developed in PHP can be executed	 on server and the 	\nresult  is  turned  to  the  browser  as  plain  HTML.  There  are  a  lot  of  things  that  PHP  is \ncapable of doing such as generating dynamic page content, collecting and encrypting \ndata and can be used to control user	-access	 (W	hat is PHP?, n.d.)	. 	\nCodeigniter	 	\n 	CodeIgniter	 comes in the Model	-View	-Controller (MVC) framework. This helps 	\nin changing 	various innovative and descriptive concepts that the users may come up 	\nwith. By usi	ng this framework,	 those concepts	 can be changed	 to actual applications. 	\nAs a developer, PHP codeigniter is	 significant for	 its simplicity	 and effective	ness	. The 	\nbiggest benefit of using CodeIgniter is that 	it can create web solutions t	hat offer a level 	\nof  proficiency	.  This  way, 	it  also 	provide	s effecti	ve  services  to  users.  Such  all	-round 	\nbenefits  are  rarely  found  in  other  frameworks.	 The  quality  of  libraries  that 	can 	be 	\naccess	ed in	 codeigniter framework development is so rich that 	it will meet all needed\n\n8 	\n \nfunctionalities  in  developing  a  system  such  as  up	loads,  cart  and  many  more	 (The 	\nbenefits of using CodeIgniter for web development, 2016)	. 	\nCSS	 	\n 	Cascading Style S	heet (CSS) is a Web page derived from multiple sources with 	\na defined order of precedence where the definitio	ns of 	any style element	. CSS saves 	\na  lot  of  work.  It  can  control  the  layout  of  multiple  pages  all  at  once.  With  the  use 	of 	\nCSS, it can change the layout of the whole H	TML design. It can also be used 	to define 	\nstyles for web pages, including the design, layout an	d variations in display for different 	\ndevices  and  screen  sizes.	 CSS  gives  more  control  over  the  appearance  of  a  Web 	\npage to the page creator than to the browser designer or the viewer.	 (Rouse, n.d.)	 	\nMySQL	 	\n 	MySQL  is  the  world\'s 	most  popular  open  source  database.  With  its  proven 	\nperf	ormance, reliability and usability.	 MySQL has become the leading database choice 	\nfor  web	-based 	applications	. Oracle  drives  MySQL  innovation,  delivering  new 	\ncapabilities to power next generation web, 	cloud, mobile and embedded applications.	 	\nUsing MySQL lets the system access and manipulate database easily 	(About MySQL, 	\nn.d.)	. 	\nBootstrap	 	\n 	Bootstrap  makes  front	-end  web  dev	elopment  faster  and  easier.  It  is	 made  for 	\npeople  of  all  skill  levels,  devices  of  all  shapes,  and  projects  of  all  sizes.	 It 	\ncontains	 HTML	- and	 CSS	-based  design  templates	 for	 typography	,  forms,  buttons, 	\nnavigation and other interface components, as well as optional	 JavaScript	 ext	ensions. 	\nWith  Bootstrap, 	developer  could	 get  extensive  and  beautiful  documentation  for 	\ncommon  HTML  elements,  dozens  of  custom  HTML  and  CSS  components,  and \nawesome jQuery plugins	. It gives the ability to easily create responsive designs. It is 	\neasy to use, 	has a responsive features it is also a b	rowser compatible	 (bootstrap, n.d.)	.\n\n9 	\n \nAJAX	 \nAjax  has  a 	method  of  exchanging  data  with  a  server,  and  updating  parts  of  a 	\nweb  page 	– witho	ut  reloading  the  entire  page. 	Ajax  is  used  to  perform	 a  callback, 	\nmaking a quick round trip to and from the server to retrieve and/or save data without \nposting the entire page back to the server.	 Ajax allows to make asynchronous calls to 	\na web server. This allows the client browser to avoid waiting for all d	ata to arrive before 	\nallowing  the  user  to  act  once  more.  Ajax  enabled  applications  will  always  be  more \nresponsive, faster and more user	-friendly.	 Ajax helps improve the speed, performance 	\nand usability of a web application	 (Segue, 20	13)	. 	\nJAVASCRIPT	 	\n 	Java  Script	 is a  programming  language  designed  specifically  for  electronic 	\ndocuments on the World Wide Web. JavaScript programs are embedded within HTML \nto add dynamic 	interactivity to web documents. JavaScript help in giving 	functionality 	\non an HTML file without difficulty in a	 full programming language	. A simple JavaScript 	\nprogram can add interesting interactive functions to a web page. It makes use of the \nuser  interface  mechanisms  already  in  HTML  to  interact  with  users  of  th	e  web 	\ndocument	. JavaScript cannot make 	a netwo	rk connection	 on its own, it 	is run by most 	\nmodern  browsers.  It 	can  be  developed  in  an	 object	-oriented  programming  and 	\nprocedural programming	 approach	 (Machajewski, n.d.)	. 	\nNAVICAT	 	\n Navicat is one of the solution in developing MySQL/MariaDB because it allows 	\nsimultaneous connection to the databases. It provides a	 natural and powerful graphical 	\ninterface  for  database  management,  development,  and  maintenance.	 It  would  be 	\neasier for the	 developer to  change  specific script  since  it  is easy  and fast  to  migrate 	\nall  needed  data. 	Navicat	 is also	 useful	 when	 it comes	 to transferring	 data	 to a database	 	\nbecause	 it supports	 export	ing	 data from tables, views, or query results to formats 	like Excel	, 	\nAccess, CSV,	 Add, modify, and delete records	. It also gives the tools 	need	ed to manage 	data 	\nefficien	tly and ensure a smooth process. Navicat e	stablish	ed	 secure connections through SSH 	\ntunneling  and  SSL  ensure	s every  connection  is  secure	d,  stable,  and 	reliable.  It  s	upport	s 	\ndifferent authentication methods of database ser	vers such as PAM authentication	 (Navicat for 	\nMySQL, n.d.)	.\n\n10	 	\n \nXAMPP	 \nXAMPP stands for Cross	-Platform (X), Apache (A), MariaDB (M), PHP (P) and 	\nPerl (P).	 It is a si	mple, lightweight Apache distribution that makes it extremely easy for 	\ndevelopers  to  create  a  local  web  server  for  testing  and  deployment  purposes. \nEverything  needed  to  set  up  a  web  server 	– server  application  (Apache),  database 	\n(MariaDB), and scripting la	nguage (PHP) 	– is included in an extractable file.	 XAMPP 	\nis  used  for  offline  modification  of  the  system.  Through  connecting  the  database  in \nnavicat, the system can be accessed easily and can be modified 	(Jangid, 2016)	. 	\nBarcode	 	\n 	Barcodes  are  used  in  the  business  process,  procedures  are  automated  to 	\nincrease produ	ctivity and reduce human error. 	Whenever there is a need to accurately 	\nidentify  or  track  something,  bar	-coding  should  be  used.  For example,  in a data entry 	\nwork 	environment, workers may be required to enter an enormous amount of data into 	\na  customer  database  system.  Instead  of  manually  typing  a  customer  identification \nnumber  into  a  database,  if  the  information  is  contained  in  a  barcode,  a  data  entry \noperator  may  s	can  it  in.  This  would  increase  au	tomation  and  reduce  human  error	 	\n(Barcode for Beginners, 2007)	.\n\n11	 	\n 	\nIdentify Objectives	 	\nand Information	 	\nRequirement	 	\n 	\nRequirement Planning	 	\nRAD De	sign Workshop	 	\nWork with Users \nto Design System	 	\n 	\nBuild the 	 	\nSystem	 	\n 	\nIntroduce the	 	\nNew System	 	\n 	\nImplementation	 	\nCHAPTER IV	 	\nMETHODOLOGY	 	\n 	\n 	This  ar	ea  discusses  the  methodology  that	 will  be  used  in  designing  the 	\nElectronic  Document  Management 	System  of  Central  Mindanao  University’s 	\nResearch Office.	 	\n \nDevelopment Methodology	 	\n \n \n \n \n \n 	 	\n 	\nFigure 3: 	The Rapid Application Development diagram	 	\n 	 	 	\n 	The	 Rapid Application Development	 (RAD)	 model is based on prototyping and 	\niterative  development  with  no  specific  planning  involved.  The  process  of  writing 	the 	\nsoftware itself involves the planning required for developing the product.	 	\nRAD	 focuses on gathering customer requirements through workshops or focus 	\ngroups, early testing of the prototypes by the customer using iterative concept, reuse \nof the existing 	prototypes (components), continuous integration and rapid delivery.	 	\nRAD is also a	 software development methodology that uses minimal planning 	\nin  favor  of  rapid  prototyping.  A  prototype  is  a  working  model  that  is  functionally \nequivalent to a component of th	e product.\n\n12	 	\n \nRequirements Planning	 	\nThe  developer  will  plan  the  whole  duration  in  developing  the  system.  From 	\ngathering  requirements,  coding  process,  system  test,  alpha  test,  bug  fixes, \nimprovements, final fixes and lastly the deployment.	 	\nThe  developer  will  do  some  data  gathering  through  Interviews.  In  the 	\nrequirements  planning  phase,  the  developer  will  conduct  interviews  with  the  staff  of \nCMU 	– Research office. After the interview and discussion, objectives will be identified 	\nand  the  infor	mation  needed  will  be  taken. 	The  developer 	will  do	 some  research  on 	\nwhat  type  of  system  should  be  used  in  order  to  help  enhance  the  whole  process  in \nuploading  and  searching  on  the  organization	. An  electronic  document  management 	\nsystem will be developed bas	ed on the interview.	  	\n 	CMU	-Research  office	 current  system  are  done  manuall	y. An  Excel	 database 	\nwas  involved  in  the  current  system  of  the  CMU	-Research  Office	.  On  the  current 	\nsystem  of  the  CMU	-Research  office	,  the  user  must  go  to  their  building  in  order  to 	\nsubmit their manuscript, also researchers must also go to the research office to look \nfor research materials therefore  research personnel’s 	will  try  to  find  the  materials o	n 	\nthe  file  to  look  for  the  topic	.  Although  the  process  is  that  simple,  it  would  be  ti	me 	\nconsuming for the 	personnel to look for the topic 	without assurance that the 	research 	\nis available. 	 	\nOn the design system, the user will register their account to be able to 	search 	\nfor  research  materials  online	.  Once  registered,  all  available 	manuscript	 titles  and 	\nabstract	 will be viewed. 	In uploading the manuscript, the student will need to use the 	\ncredentials stored in the existing database	. It will be verified by the server 	if the student 	\nhas completed all the requirement prior to the submission of ma	nuscript	. If 	the student 	\nhas not yet completed the requirements the system will mark the uploaded manuscript \n“In  progress”	.  If  the 	student  has  completed  the  requirements  the  system  will  then 	\nprovide the student with Research Number and will be mark with “O	K”.	 	\n 	The  designed  system  provides  convenience  to  the  user  because  they  will  no 	\nlonger be inquiring at the CMU	-Research office	 just to 	submit their manuscript also the 	\nresearch office personnel will no longer have to look over a lot of paper to look for the	 	\nresearch  material  needed.	 Unlike  the  current  system  where  they  have  to  personally\n\n13	 	\n \nsearch	 thus  consuming	 time	. This  is one  of  the  reasons  why  the  designed  system  is 	\nmuch helpful and convenient on the 	CMU	-Research office personnel.	 	\nUser Design	 	\n During  this 	phase,  the  developer  will  creat	e a  prototype  that  represent  all 	\nsystem process, inputs and outputs on the EDMS. As for the design of the system, the \ndevelo	per  will  use	 Bootstrap,  HTML,  CSS  and  JS  framework  for  it  to  be  responsive 	\nwhich can be viewed in any end devices like smartph	ones and tablets. The database 	\nsystem  used  in  the  project  will	 be	 MySQL  and  SQL  server  together  with  Navicat 	\nMySQL.  Navicat  is  a  software  for 	database  management.  In  order  to  access  the 	\ndatabase, the developer will use Codeigniter for it to function according to its process.	 	\nIn order to elaborate the whole process of the developed system, the developer 	\nwill create a context diagram. The context 	diagram will show that the user will input its 	\ncredentials.  The  administrator will then  manage  the  transactions made  by  the  online \nsystem. 	 	\n 	In  order  to  identify  the  functional features  that  will  be  added  to  the  developed	 	\nsystem,  a use  case  diagram 	will be	 designed.  All  actions  that the user can  do  in  the 	\nweb	-based  application 	will  be	 shown  in  the  figure.  The  user  of  the  system 	will	 be 	\nresearchers	, CMU	-Research office	 and 	the student	s of CMU.	 	\nThe  developer	 will  conduct  an  interview  and  will  mak	e  some  resear	ches  with 	\nCentral  Mindanao  University	-Research  office  personnel	 	and  management. 	\nInformation about the organization’s needs 	will be	 taken. After the conducted research, 	\nthe  developer	 will  design  a  system  that  will	 meet  the organization’s needs.  An  entity 	\nrelationship diagram 	will be	 created to represent the flow	. 	\n 	A  data  di	ctionar	y will  show	 the  description  of  the  fields  used  in  the  system.  It 	\nwill show	 what field and type of data 	will be	 used. 	 	\nConstruction	 	\n Durin	g  the 	development  of  the  system,  the  developer  will  gather  some 	\ninformation on what is best to use in developing a web	-based system. With these, the 	\ndeveloper  will  use  C	odeigniter  as  its  framework.  The  system  will  be  developed  with\n\n14	 	\n \nPHP, HTML, CSS and other	 programming languages that is necessary in fulfilling the 	\nneeds of the	 system. Also, with the use of C	odeigniter the development stage will be 	\nmade easier. With the help of its built	-in libraries and other functionalities such as add 	\nto cart, upload and c	onstructors. The developer will use procedural and object oriented 	\nprogramming approach on the coding process. There are also different structures that \nwill use like Statements (if) and Loop (foreach) in conditioning the codes.  	 	\n 	 In  developing  the	 system	 there  are  tools  that  will  be	 used.    For  the  user 	\ninterface,  the  developer 	will  use	 HTM	L,  CSS  and  bootstrap.  HTML  provides  the 	\ngraphical  interface  of  the  system  such  as  buttons,  inputs,  checkbox, 	attributes	 and 	\nmany more. CSS was used 	to quickly create lay	outs, and troubleshoot any problems 	\nwhen designing a website. Bootstrap 	will be use	 for the system to be responsive. For 	\nthe back end of the system, the developer 	will use	 PHP, Codeigniter Framework and 	\nAjax. 	PHP generates dynamic page content and it also allows to store and fetch data 	\non the database. 	Co	deigniter will help the developer 	develop a system in a simple way 	\nwith the help of its built	-in functions and constructors. 	Ajax 	will be use	 for the system 	\nto	 be more responsive, faster and more user	-friendly. Other tools such as Navicat and 	\nXAMPP 	will	 also	 be use	d for connectivity and access to the database used.	 	\nSoftware Requirements	 	\n 	Software  requirements  in  building  the  system  will  be  browsers  like  Google 	\nChrome, Firefox, Safari, Internet Explorer and Opera Mini. Also, Sublime Text Editor, \nFileZilla (version 3.20.1 or later), Navicat (version 10.0.6 or later). 	 	\nHardware Requirements	 	\n 	The minimum requirements in developing the system are at least Intel Pentium 	\n4  or  newer  processor  that  support  SSE2  and  512MB  of  Random  Access  Memory \n(RAM).	  	\nImplementation	 	\nAs soon as the aspects on	 the systems are built and refined, the new systems 	\nor par	t of systems are tested and then introduced to the organization. Because RAD 	\ncan be used to create new ecommerce applications for which there is no old system, \nthere  is  often  no  need  to  run  the  old  and  new  systems  in  parallel  before \nimplementation.\n\n15	 	\n \nTesting	 	\n 	During  the  testing  phase  of  the  system,  the  developer 	will  conduct	 an  Alpha 	\nand  Beta  testing.	 An  alpha  test  is  a  preliminary  software  field  test  carried  out  by 	the 	\ndeveloper 	in order to find bugs that were not found previously through other tests. The 	\nmain purpose of alpha testing is to refine t	he software product by finding and fixing 	the 	\nbugs that were not discovered through previous tests	 (Alpha Test, n.d.)	. Alpha testing 	\nwill be	 done by the developer to test whether all features are functionally capable. The 	\ndeveloper 	will also explore	 capabilities of the whole system. It is usually done during 	\nthe whole process of developing the system.	 A beta testing is when	 applications are 	\nsu	bjected to real world testing by the intended 	user	 for the 	website	. In the Beta testing, 	\nother  personnel  like  CMU  students 	will	 test  the  system.  Users  who  are  new  to  the 	\nsystem will be using it and will determine if the system is	 suitable for the organizat	ion. 	\nBeta testing is done in order to know if the system is useful to the organization. In this \ntest, the developer will know the features on the system that need improvements.	 	\nSoftware Requirements	 	\n 	In  the  implementation  phase,  the  minimum  software  requirements  are  web 	\nbrowsers such as Google Chrome (version 3.0.195 or later), Mozilla Firefox (version \n54.0.1  or  later),  Opera  Mini  (version  11.52),  Safari  (version  4.0.3  for  Mac  OS  and \nversion 4.0 for Wi	ndows X or later), Internet Explorer Edge (version 21.10547 or later). 	 	\n Hardware Requirement	 	\n 	For  the  hardware  minimum  requirements  are  internet  connected  end  devices 	\nsuch as tablets and smartphones capable to open the mentioned browsers.	 A barcode 	\nprinte	r and a barcode scanner using linear barcode (Code 128).	  	\nOperating System	 	\n 	As  for  the  operating  system  the  website  can  be  opened  through  mobile  or 	\ndesktop. For desktop, it must be at least a Windows XP or later. As for the mobile, it \nmust be at least a 	gingerbread 2.3.7 for android and IOS 8.', '2018-06-22 08:46:38', '2018-06-22 08:46:38');

Moreover, EDMS provides a more compact means of storage, universal 	\naccess for retrieval, and higher levels of data security and privacy.	 	\n 	The process of EDMS has to do with capturing, storing, indexing and retrieval. 	\nit improves the accessing of informatio	n by the users of the organization wherein they 	\ncan  easily  search  and  retrieve  the  documents  needed.  Also,  there will  be  security  in \nsuch  a  way  that  the  only  authorized  users  are  allowed  to  access  the  particular \ndocuments. 	 	\n \nProject Context	 	\n 	Central  Mindan	ao  University 	– Research  office  is  responsible 	for  signing  of 	\nthesis/dissertation,  thesis  manuscripts,  routinely  requests  and  advising  on  research \nstatistics/data  analysis.  Services  made  by  the  office  is  done  manually,  daily \ntransactions  are  written  or  enc	oded  and  stored  in  one  place  which  cause  them 	\ndifficulties in tracking information or data in a specific date. 	 	\n \nPurpose and Description	 	\n 	Developing  an  EDMS  would  make  the	 Research  office  services  more 	\npresentable and convenient. With this, the developer will work to create an EDMS that \nwill save and manage the student’s manuscripts.	 The web application will be expected 	\nto give users a new experience in interacting with the	 said EDMS.	 	\n 	The development of such web application will help users look for the research 	\nmaterials they’re lookin	g. Transactions will be done through online from uploading of 	\nmanuscripts and searching for possible research material. The web application w	ill be 	\neasy to use and accessible to all users.\n\n2 	\n \nObjectives of the Project	 	\n 	The  general	 objective	 of  this  project  is  to  design,  develop  and  implement  an 	\nElectronic Document Management System for Central Mindanao University Research \nOffice.	 	\n 	Specifically, t	he study aims to:	 	\n1. design a	nd create a	 database structure for record repository;	 	\n2. design a	nd create a	 website that is accessible and easy to use;	 	\n3. design and develop a web	-based application for document management;	 	\n4. allo	w uploading of documents online;	 	\n5. automatically 	assign categories and tags to uploaded documents;	 	\n6. employ barcode for tracking hardcopy of documents.	 	\n \nSignificance of the Study	 	\n 	The  significance  of  the  web	-based  application	 (EDMS)	 will  be  to  offer  great 	\nconvenience to the student’s submitting their manuscript. It giv	es them lesser amount 	\nof  effort,	 conserve  their  time  and  energy	 by  letting  them  upload  their  manuscript 	\nanywhere  they  want	. As  for  the  admin  side  it  will  hasten  the  sea	rch  of  research 	\nmaterials 	since	 all  the manuscripts  uploaded are  cat	egorize/segregated accordingly	, 	\nalso with the use of barcode they will be able to track the documents barrowed.	 	\n 	With the use of EDMS it will help reduce overhead of staff time and	 acceler	ate 	\nflow of information since everything is done electronically.	 EDMS will provide	 a more 	\ncompact means of storage	 and higher levels of data security and privacy.\n\n3 	\n \nConceptual Framework	 	\n 	\nFigure 1	: Conceptual Paradigm	 	\n 	\n 	Figure 1 shows the conceptual 	paradigm in developing an Electronic Document 	\nManagement System. Those who	 will	 access the website will be directed to the server 	\nwhich is connected to the database locally and all the data provided in the file system \nwill  be  viewed.  With  this,  all 	operati	on  will  be  made  easy  from  the  user  up  until  the 	\nadministrator’s side.	 	\n \nScope and Limitations of the project	  	\n 	The EDMS will be intended to the users to upload and inquire for manuscripts. 	\nIt will have the ability to search for keyword(s) inside the 	manuscript and return the title 	\nand abstract containing the keyword(s). The users of the system can be anybody as \nlong  as  registered  in  the  website.  All  details  on  the  website  will  be  provided  by  the \nadministrator on the server side.	 	\n 	The users must 	have a	n account in the website in order to search for research 	\nmaterials. 	The EDMS will employ a search	-engine style of searching for not only exact 	\nmatches but for relevant documents as well. 	Only the title and abstract will be provided 	\nto  the  users,  obtaining 	the  whole  manuscript  will  need  to  have  the  author’s 	\nauthorization.  There  will  be  no  downloading  involved  during  the  whole  process,  all \nmanuscripts or research material must be claimed at the CMU Research office along \nwith the authorization of the author.	 The hard copy of the manuscript will be provided\n\n4 	\n \nwith  a 	barcode;	 the  barcode  will  be	 scanned  by  a  barcode  scanner 	in  order  to 	\ndetermine if the manuscript is being barrowed or is within the Research office.	 On the 	\nuploading  of  manuscripts,  the  student  must  b	e  a  bona  fide  student  of  Central 	\nMindanao  University  and  must  have  completed  all  the  requirements  needed. 	When 	\nuploading the manuscript, the EDMS will automatically assign categories and tags for \nlesser human error.	 	\n 	Statistical  data  will  also  be  displayed	 by  the  web	-application,  this  will  include 	\nstatistical data of student’s course, college, study, and field.	 	\nThe student’s account will b	e coming from the existing data	base	 to access the 	\nwebsite. The existing database will be used by the researcher to develop the EDMS.	 	\nThe  manuscript’s  must  be  in  portable  document  format(PDF)  in  order  for  it  to 	\nbe uploaded.	 Checking of manuscript content for plagiarism will not be included i	n this 	\nstudy.\n\n5 	\n 	\nCHAPTER II	 	\nREVIEW OF RELATED LITERATURE	 	\n  	\nIn  common  language  the  word  document  usually  means  a  container  of 	\ninformation (usually on paper) containing written or drawn information for a particular \npurpose in structured way. Traditionally, a	 document is a piece of paper or a collection 	\nof papers, for instance, a memo, a letter, a mission statement or a customer invoice. \nCentral  to  the  idea  of  a  document  is  usually  that  it  can  be  easily  transferred,  stored \nand  handled  as  a  unit.  Over  the  last 	decade,  the  term  document  has  undergone  a 	\nradical  change  in  definition.  This  change  is partly  due  to  IT.  Thus  a  large  part  of  the \ndocuments handled in today’s business world are stored as individual computer files \nand  are  treaded  as  units  by  the  operating 	and  email  system	 (Life  Cycle  Document 	\nManagement System for Construction, n.d.)	 	\nWeb  application  usability  is  an  evolving  issue.  As  we  learn  more  and  more 	\nabout how our users interact with web application, how our users retrieve i	nformation 	\nand  use  it,  what  our  users  anticipate  within  their  realm  of  experiences,  we  can \niteratively improve our design and implementation	 (Wang, 2006)	. 	\nA  portal is a  system  that  serves  as  a  centralized  place  for accessing  d	ifferent 	\nresources in the Web (Atlantic Webfitters, 2014). It gathers information from different \nsources and put it all together in a single place which can help in accessing information \nby  several  users.  It  provides  the  users  with  a  single  point  of  conten	t,  data,  and 	\nservices. It can be personalized depending on the role of the user in the organization \n(Eldrandaly, 2009). There are different types of portal: general, community, horizontal, \nvertical,  enterprise,  personal,  and  niche.  Community  Portal  is  a  sy	stem  where  the 	\nusers are of same group of interests (Tatnall, 2005). 	 	\nElectronic document management solutions are designed to organize business 	\nfiles  and  records  digitally,  whether  they  started  out  in  paper form  or were  generated \nby  software  applications.	 Paper  files  are  first  converted  to  electronic  format  by 	\nscanning.  This  provides  a  more  compact  means  of  storage,  universal  access  for \nretrieval, and higher levels of data security and privacy	 (Easy Document Management: 	\nA Guide to B	enefits, Features, and Selection, 2011)	.\n\n6 	\n 	\nCodeigniter Development is one of the best PHP framework in web Application 	\nDevelopment. If a developer wished to develop an application in a better way, then the \nonly  option  is  web  development  with  framework.  As  compared  to  the  other \nframeworks,  Codeignit	er  Development  is  fast  and  reliable.  Its  time  and  speed  are 	\nsignificant.  The  developer  can  modify  (software)  for  use  on  a  different  machine  or \nplatform  for  existing  codes  by  using  PHP  framework.  PHP  server  side  scripting \nlanguage  is  very  useful,  In  PHP  sof	tware  development,  PHP  programming  or  PHP 	\napplication  development  or  outsourcing  PHP  is  used 	(What  is  Codeigniter  and  its 	\nadvantages, 2014)	. 	\nThere  are  a  lot  of  benefits  the  codeigniter framework can  offer. Aside from  its 	\nfast, 	reliable, lightweight and more capability. PHP helps in fixing errors on the system 	\neasily.  Through  this  framework,  developer  can  achieve  the  desired  specification  on \nthe developed system. Codeigniter Development can extend on PHP coding to get the \nspecifi	c functions through frameworks. In web Development, many features are almost 	\nthe  same  so  that  can  describe  the  same  code  in  different  way.  Codeigniter  PHP \nDevelopment is the easiest way to employ a program. It is compatible with most web \nservers,  numerous 	operating  systems  and  platforms.  This  framework  has  an 	\noutstanding  performance  and  it  is  famous  among  developer  especially  on  web \ndeveloping	 (Major  Benefits  of  Using  Codeigniter  PHP  Framework  Development, 	\n2016)	. \nPHP	 is one of 	the most popularly used languages for	 web development	 as well 	\nas	 web application development	. Reasons are 	it has 	Perfect Database Interaction:	  it 	\ncan  exchange  all  sorts  of  information  with  ease.  Another  reason  why	 PHP 	website 	\ndevelopment	 and	 web  developme	nt is  admired  by  developers  is  that	 PHP	 programs 	\nare free. Also, the database connectivity is less expensive as compared to that of other \nprograms  such  as  ASP  and  a  Microsoft  product  that  needs  to  be  purchased. \nHowever,	 web development with PHP	 through MyS	QL is free to use.	 PHP	 has also an 	\nupper hand when it comes to speed. This is mainly because, the	 PHP	 code runs faster 	\nas it runs in its own memory space	 (How is PHP used in Web Development, n.d.)	.\n\n7 	\n 	\nCHAPTER III	 	\nTECHNICAL 	BACKGROUND	 	\n \n HTML	 	\n 	Hypertext Mark	-up Language (	HTML) is a computer language devised to allow 	\nwebsite  creation.  These  websites  can  then  be  viewed  by  anyone  else  connected  to \nthe  internet.  It  is  relatively  easy  to  learn,  with  the  basics  being  accessible  to  m	ost 	\npeople in one session and it is quite powerful in what it allows the developer to create. \nIn  developing  a  website  HTML  is  handy.  HTML  codes  are  also  accessible  when  it \ncomes  to  the  coding  process  because  it  can  be  edited  through  Sublime  Text, \nProgramme	rs  Notepad  or  just  simply  a  notepad  editor.  Aside  that  it  helps  on  giving 	\nfunctionalities  on  the  program,  it  is  also  one  of  the  reason  why  designing  became \neasier 	(Shannon, 2012)	. 	\nPHP	 	 	\n 	PHP  Hypertext  Preprocessor  (PHP)  is  a 	widely	-used  open  source  general	-	\npurpose scripting language that is especially suited for web development and can be \nembedded  into  HTML.  PHP  is  also  a  powerful  tool  in  developing  an  interactive  and \ndynamic web page. The code developed in PHP can be executed	 on server and the 	\nresult  is  turned  to  the  browser  as  plain  HTML.  There  are  a  lot  of  things  that  PHP  is \ncapable of doing such as generating dynamic page content, collecting and encrypting \ndata and can be used to control user	-access	 (W	hat is PHP?, n.d.)	. 	\nCodeigniter	 	\n 	CodeIgniter	 comes in the Model	-View	-Controller (MVC) framework. This helps 	\nin changing 	various innovative and descriptive concepts that the users may come up 	\nwith. By usi	ng this framework,	 those concepts	 can be changed	 to actual applications. 	\nAs a developer, PHP codeigniter is	 significant for	 its simplicity	 and effective	ness	. The 	\nbiggest benefit of using CodeIgniter is that 	it can create web solutions t	hat offer a level 	\nof  proficiency	.  This  way, 	it  also 	provide	s effecti	ve  services  to  users.  Such  all	-round 	\nbenefits  are  rarely  found  in  other  frameworks.	 The  quality  of  libraries  that 	can 	be 	\naccess	ed in	 codeigniter framework development is so rich that 	it will meet all needed\n\n8 	\n \nfunctionalities  in  developing  a  system  such  as  up	loads,  cart  and  many  more	 (The 	\nbenefits of using CodeIgniter for web development, 2016)	. 	\nCSS	 	\n 	Cascading Style S	heet (CSS) is a Web page derived from multiple sources with 	\na defined order of precedence where the definitio	ns of 	any style element	. CSS saves 	\na  lot  of  work.  It  can  control  the  layout  of  multiple  pages  all  at  once.  With  the  use 	of 	\nCSS, it can change the layout of the whole H	TML design. It can also be used 	to define 	\nstyles for web pages, including the design, layout an	d variations in display for different 	\ndevices  and  screen  sizes.	 CSS  gives  more  control  over  the  appearance  of  a  Web 	\npage to the page creator than to the browser designer or the viewer.	 (Rouse, n.d.)	 	\nMySQL	 	\n 	MySQL  is  the  world\'s 	most  popular  open  source  database.  With  its  proven 	\nperf	ormance, reliability and usability.	 MySQL has become the leading database choice 	\nfor  web	-based 	applications	. Oracle  drives  MySQL  innovation,  delivering  new 	\ncapabilities to power next generation web, 	cloud, mobile and embedded applications.	 	\nUsing MySQL lets the system access and manipulate database easily 	(About MySQL, 	\nn.d.)	. 	\nBootstrap	 	\n 	Bootstrap  makes  front	-end  web  dev	elopment  faster  and  easier.  It  is	 made  for 	\npeople  of  all  skill  levels,  devices  of  all  shapes,  and  projects  of  all  sizes.	 It 	\ncontains	 HTML	- and	 CSS	-based  design  templates	 for	 typography	,  forms,  buttons, 	\nnavigation and other interface components, as well as optional	 JavaScript	 ext	ensions. 	\nWith  Bootstrap, 	developer  could	 get  extensive  and  beautiful  documentation  for 	\ncommon  HTML  elements,  dozens  of  custom  HTML  and  CSS  components,  and \nawesome jQuery plugins	. It gives the ability to easily create responsive designs. It is 	\neasy to use, 	has a responsive features it is also a b	rowser compatible	 (bootstrap, n.d.)	.\n\n9 	\n \nAJAX	 \nAjax  has  a 	method  of  exchanging  data  with  a  server,  and  updating  parts  of  a 	\nweb  page 	– witho	ut  reloading  the  entire  page. 	Ajax  is  used  to  perform	 a  callback, 	\nmaking a quick round trip to and from the server to retrieve and/or save data without \nposting the entire page back to the server.	 Ajax allows to make asynchronous calls to 	\na web server. This allows the client browser to avoid waiting for all d	ata to arrive before 	\nallowing  the  user  to  act  once  more.  Ajax  enabled  applications  will  always  be  more \nresponsive, faster and more user	-friendly.	 Ajax helps improve the speed, performance 	\nand usability of a web application	 (Segue, 20	13)	. 	\nJAVASCRIPT	 	\n 	Java  Script	 is a  programming  language  designed  specifically  for  electronic 	\ndocuments on the World Wide Web. JavaScript programs are embedded within HTML \nto add dynamic 	interactivity to web documents. JavaScript help in giving 	functionality 	\non an HTML file without difficulty in a	 full programming language	. A simple JavaScript 	\nprogram can add interesting interactive functions to a web page. It makes use of the \nuser  interface  mechanisms  already  in  HTML  to  interact  with  users  of  th	e  web 	\ndocument	. JavaScript cannot make 	a netwo	rk connection	 on its own, it 	is run by most 	\nmodern  browsers.  It 	can  be  developed  in  an	 object	-oriented  programming  and 	\nprocedural programming	 approach	 (Machajewski, n.d.)	. 	\nNAVICAT	 	\n Navicat is one of the solution in developing MySQL/MariaDB because it allows 	\nsimultaneous connection to the databases. It provides a	 natural and powerful graphical 	\ninterface  for  database  management,  development,  and  maintenance.	 It  would  be 	\neasier for the	 developer to  change  specific script  since  it  is easy  and fast  to  migrate 	\nall  needed  data. 	Navicat	 is also	 useful	 when	 it comes	 to transferring	 data	 to a database	 	\nbecause	 it supports	 export	ing	 data from tables, views, or query results to formats 	like Excel	, 	\nAccess, CSV,	 Add, modify, and delete records	. It also gives the tools 	need	ed to manage 	data 	\nefficien	tly and ensure a smooth process. Navicat e	stablish	ed	 secure connections through SSH 	\ntunneling  and  SSL  ensure	s every  connection  is  secure	d,  stable,  and 	reliable.  It  s	upport	s 	\ndifferent authentication methods of database ser	vers such as PAM authentication	 (Navicat for 	\nMySQL, n.d.)	.\n\n10	 	\n \nXAMPP	 \nXAMPP stands for Cross	-Platform (X), Apache (A), MariaDB (M), PHP (P) and 	\nPerl (P).	 It is a si	mple, lightweight Apache distribution that makes it extremely easy for 	\ndevelopers  to  create  a  local  web  server  for  testing  and  deployment  purposes. \nEverything  needed  to  set  up  a  web  server 	– server  application  (Apache),  database 	\n(MariaDB), and scripting la	nguage (PHP) 	– is included in an extractable file.	 XAMPP 	\nis  used  for  offline  modification  of  the  system.  Through  connecting  the  database  in \nnavicat, the system can be accessed easily and can be modified 	(Jangid, 2016)	. 	\nBarcode	 	\n 	Barcodes  are  used  in  the  business  process,  procedures  are  automated  to 	\nincrease produ	ctivity and reduce human error. 	Whenever there is a need to accurately 	\nidentify  or  track  something,  bar	-coding  should  be  used.  For example,  in a data entry 	\nwork 	environment, workers may be required to enter an enormous amount of data into 	\na  customer  database  system.  Instead  of  manually  typing  a  customer  identification \nnumber  into  a  database,  if  the  information  is  contained  in  a  barcode,  a  data  entry \noperator  may  s	can  it  in.  This  would  increase  au	tomation  and  reduce  human  error	 	\n(Barcode for Beginners, 2007)	.\n\n11	 	\n 	\nIdentify Objectives	 	\nand Information	 	\nRequirement	 	\n 	\nRequirement Planning	 	\nRAD De	sign Workshop	 	\nWork with Users \nto Design System	 	\n 	\nBuild the 	 	\nSystem	 	\n 	\nIntroduce the	 	\nNew System	 	\n 	\nImplementation	 	\nCHAPTER IV	 	\nMETHODOLOGY	 	\n 	\n 	This  ar	ea  discusses  the  methodology  that	 will  be  used  in  designing  the 	\nElectronic  Document  Management 	System  of  Central  Mindanao  University’s 	\nResearch Office.	 	\n \nDevelopment Methodology	 	\n \n \n \n \n \n 	 	\n 	\nFigure 3: 	The Rapid Application Development diagram	 	\n 	 	 	\n 	The	 Rapid Application Development	 (RAD)	 model is based on prototyping and 	\niterative  development  with  no  specific  planning  involved.  The  process  of  writing 	the 	\nsoftware itself involves the planning required for developing the product.	 	\nRAD	 focuses on gathering customer requirements through workshops or focus 	\ngroups, early testing of the prototypes by the customer using iterative concept, reuse \nof the existing 	prototypes (components), continuous integration and rapid delivery.	 	\nRAD is also a	 software development methodology that uses minimal planning 	\nin  favor  of  rapid  prototyping.  A  prototype  is  a  working  model  that  is  functionally \nequivalent to a component of th	e product.\n\n12	 	\n \nRequirements Planning	 	\nThe  developer  will  plan  the  whole  duration  in  developing  the  system.  From 	\ngathering  requirements,  coding  process,  system  test,  alpha  test,  bug  fixes, \nimprovements, final fixes and lastly the deployment.	 	\nThe  developer  will  do  some  data  gathering  through  Interviews.  In  the 	\nrequirements  planning  phase,  the  developer  will  conduct  interviews  with  the  staff  of \nCMU 	– Research office. After the interview and discussion, objectives will be identified 	\nand  the  infor	mation  needed  will  be  taken. 	The  developer 	will  do	 some  research  on 	\nwhat  type  of  system  should  be  used  in  order  to  help  enhance  the  whole  process  in \nuploading  and  searching  on  the  organization	. An  electronic  document  management 	\nsystem will be developed bas	ed on the interview.	  	\n 	CMU	-Research  office	 current  system  are  done  manuall	y. An  Excel	 database 	\nwas  involved  in  the  current  system  of  the  CMU	-Research  Office	.  On  the  current 	\nsystem  of  the  CMU	-Research  office	,  the  user  must  go  to  their  building  in  order  to 	\nsubmit their manuscript, also researchers must also go to the research office to look \nfor research materials therefore  research personnel’s 	will  try  to  find  the  materials o	n 	\nthe  file  to  look  for  the  topic	.  Although  the  process  is  that  simple,  it  would  be  ti	me 	\nconsuming for the 	personnel to look for the topic 	without assurance that the 	research 	\nis available. 	 	\nOn the design system, the user will register their account to be able to 	search 	\nfor  research  materials  online	.  Once  registered,  all  available 	manuscript	 titles  and 	\nabstract	 will be viewed. 	In uploading the manuscript, the student will need to use the 	\ncredentials stored in the existing database	. It will be verified by the server 	if the student 	\nhas completed all the requirement prior to the submission of ma	nuscript	. If 	the student 	\nhas not yet completed the requirements the system will mark the uploaded manuscript \n“In  progress”	.  If  the 	student  has  completed  the  requirements  the  system  will  then 	\nprovide the student with Research Number and will be mark with “O	K”.	 	\n 	The  designed  system  provides  convenience  to  the  user  because  they  will  no 	\nlonger be inquiring at the CMU	-Research office	 just to 	submit their manuscript also the 	\nresearch office personnel will no longer have to look over a lot of paper to look for the	 	\nresearch  material  needed.	 Unlike  the  current  system  where  they  have  to  personally\n\n13	 	\n \nsearch	 thus  consuming	 time	. This  is one  of  the  reasons  why  the  designed  system  is 	\nmuch helpful and convenient on the 	CMU	-Research office personnel.	 	\nUser Design	 	\n During  this 	phase,  the  developer  will  creat	e a  prototype  that  represent  all 	\nsystem process, inputs and outputs on the EDMS. As for the design of the system, the \ndevelo	per  will  use	 Bootstrap,  HTML,  CSS  and  JS  framework  for  it  to  be  responsive 	\nwhich can be viewed in any end devices like smartph	ones and tablets. The database 	\nsystem  used  in  the  project  will	 be	 MySQL  and  SQL  server  together  with  Navicat 	\nMySQL.  Navicat  is  a  software  for 	database  management.  In  order  to  access  the 	\ndatabase, the developer will use Codeigniter for it to function according to its process.	 	\nIn order to elaborate the whole process of the developed system, the developer 	\nwill create a context diagram. The context 	diagram will show that the user will input its 	\ncredentials.  The  administrator will then  manage  the  transactions made  by  the  online \nsystem. 	 	\n 	In  order  to  identify  the  functional features  that  will  be  added  to  the  developed	 	\nsystem,  a use  case  diagram 	will be	 designed.  All  actions  that the user can  do  in  the 	\nweb	-based  application 	will  be	 shown  in  the  figure.  The  user  of  the  system 	will	 be 	\nresearchers	, CMU	-Research office	 and 	the student	s of CMU.	 	\nThe  developer	 will  conduct  an  interview  and  will  mak	e  some  resear	ches  with 	\nCentral  Mindanao  University	-Research  office  personnel	 	and  management. 	\nInformation about the organization’s needs 	will be	 taken. After the conducted research, 	\nthe  developer	 will  design  a  system  that  will	 meet  the organization’s needs.  An  entity 	\nrelationship diagram 	will be	 created to represent the flow	. 	\n 	A  data  di	ctionar	y will  show	 the  description  of  the  fields  used  in  the  system.  It 	\nwill show	 what field and type of data 	will be	 used. 	 	\nConstruction	 	\n Durin	g  the 	development  of  the  system,  the  developer  will  gather  some 	\ninformation on what is best to use in developing a web	-based system. With these, the 	\ndeveloper  will  use  C	odeigniter  as  its  framework.  The  system  will  be  developed  with\n\n14	 	\n \nPHP, HTML, CSS and other	 programming languages that is necessary in fulfilling the 	\nneeds of the	 system. Also, with the use of C	odeigniter the development stage will be 	\nmade easier. With the help of its built	-in libraries and other functionalities such as add 	\nto cart, upload and c	onstructors. The developer will use procedural and object oriented 	\nprogramming approach on the coding process. There are also different structures that \nwill use like Statements (if) and Loop (foreach) in conditioning the codes.  	 	\n 	 In  developing  the	 system	 there  are  tools  that  will  be	 used.    For  the  user 	\ninterface,  the  developer 	will  use	 HTM	L,  CSS  and  bootstrap.  HTML  provides  the 	\ngraphical  interface  of  the  system  such  as  buttons,  inputs,  checkbox, 	attributes	 and 	\nmany more. CSS was used 	to quickly create lay	outs, and troubleshoot any problems 	\nwhen designing a website. Bootstrap 	will be use	 for the system to be responsive. For 	\nthe back end of the system, the developer 	will use	 PHP, Codeigniter Framework and 	\nAjax. 	PHP generates dynamic page content and it also allows to store and fetch data 	\non the database. 	Co	deigniter will help the developer 	develop a system in a simple way 	\nwith the help of its built	-in functions and constructors. 	Ajax 	will be use	 for the system 	\nto	 be more responsive, faster and more user	-friendly. Other tools such as Navicat and 	\nXAMPP 	will	 also	 be use	d for connectivity and access to the database used.	 	\nSoftware Requirements	 	\n 	Software  requirements  in  building  the  system  will  be  browsers  like  Google 	\nChrome, Firefox, Safari, Internet Explorer and Opera Mini. Also, Sublime Text Editor, \nFileZilla (version 3.20.1 or later), Navicat (version 10.0.6 or later). 	 	\nHardware Requirements	 	\n 	The minimum requirements in developing the system are at least Intel Pentium 	\n4  or  newer  processor  that  support  SSE2  and  512MB  of  Random  Access  Memory \n(RAM).	  	\nImplementation	 	\nAs soon as the aspects on	 the systems are built and refined, the new systems 	\nor par	t of systems are tested and then introduced to the organization. Because RAD 	\ncan be used to create new ecommerce applications for which there is no old system, \nthere  is  often  no  need  to  run  the  old  and  new  systems  in  parallel  before \nimplementation.\n\n15	 	\n \nTesting	 	\n 	During  the  testing  phase  of  the  system,  the  developer 	will  conduct	 an  Alpha 	\nand  Beta  testing.	 An  alpha  test  is  a  preliminary  software  field  test  carried  out  by 	the 	\ndeveloper 	in order to find bugs that were not found previously through other tests. The 	\nmain purpose of alpha testing is to refine t	he software product by finding and fixing 	the 	\nbugs that were not discovered through previous tests	 (Alpha Test, n.d.)	. Alpha testing 	\nwill be	 done by the developer to test whether all features are functionally capable. The 	\ndeveloper 	will also explore	 capabilities of the whole system. It is usually done during 	\nthe whole process of developing the system.	 A beta testing is when	 applications are 	\nsu	bjected to real world testing by the intended 	user	 for the 	website	. In the Beta testing, 	\nother  personnel  like  CMU  students 	will	 test  the  system.  Users  who  are  new  to  the 	\nsystem will be using it and will determine if the system is	 suitable for the organizat	ion. 	\nBeta testing is done in order to know if the system is useful to the organization. In this \ntest, the developer will know the features on the system that need improvements.	 	\nSoftware Requirements	 	\n 	In  the  implementation  phase,  the  minimum  software  requirements  are  web 	\nbrowsers such as Google Chrome (version 3.0.195 or later), Mozilla Firefox (version \n54.0.1  or  later),  Opera  Mini  (version  11.52),  Safari  (version  4.0.3  for  Mac  OS  and \nversion 4.0 for Wi	ndows X or later), Internet Explorer Edge (version 21.10547 or later). 	 	\n Hardware Requirement	 	\n 	For  the  hardware  minimum  requirements  are  internet  connected  end  devices 	\nsuch as tablets and smartphones capable to open the mentioned browsers.	 A barcode 	\nprinte	r and a barcode scanner using linear barcode (Code 128).	  	\nOperating System	 	\n 	As  for  the  operating  system  the  website  can  be  opened  through  mobile  or 	\ndesktop. For desktop, it must be at least a Windows XP or later. As for the mobile, it \nmust be at least a 	gingerbread 2.3.7 for android and IOS 8.', '2018-06-27 07:57:46', '2018-06-27 07:57:46');

Moreover, EDMS provides a more compact means of storage, universal 	\naccess for retrieval, and higher levels of data security and privacy.	 	\n 	The process of EDMS has to do with capturing, storing, indexing and retrieval. 	\nit improves the accessing of informatio	n by the users of the organization wherein they 	\ncan  easily  search  and  retrieve  the  documents  needed.  Also,  there will  be  security  in \nsuch  a  way  that  the  only  authorized  users  are  allowed  to  access  the  particular \ndocuments. 	 	\n \nProject Context	 	\n 	Central  Mindan	ao  University 	– Research  office  is  responsible 	for  signing  of 	\nthesis/dissertation,  thesis  manuscripts,  routinely  requests  and  advising  on  research \nstatistics/data  analysis.  Services  made  by  the  office  is  done  manually,  daily \ntransactions  are  written  or  enc	oded  and  stored  in  one  place  which  cause  them 	\ndifficulties in tracking information or data in a specific date. 	 	\n \nPurpose and Description	 	\n 	Developing  an  EDMS  would  make  the	 Research  office  services  more 	\npresentable and convenient. With this, the developer will work to create an EDMS that \nwill save and manage the student’s manuscripts.	 The web application will be expected 	\nto give users a new experience in interacting with the	 said EDMS.	 	\n 	The development of such web application will help users look for the research 	\nmaterials they’re lookin	g. Transactions will be done through online from uploading of 	\nmanuscripts and searching for possible research material. The web application w	ill be 	\neasy to use and accessible to all users.\n\n2 	\n \nObjectives of the Project	 	\n 	The  general	 objective	 of  this  project  is  to  design,  develop  and  implement  an 	\nElectronic Document Management System for Central Mindanao University Research \nOffice.	 	\n 	Specifically, t	he study aims to:	 	\n1. design a	nd create a	 database structure for record repository;	 	\n2. design a	nd create a	 website that is accessible and easy to use;	 	\n3. design and develop a web	-based application for document management;	 	\n4. allo	w uploading of documents online;	 	\n5. automatically 	assign categories and tags to uploaded documents;	 	\n6. employ barcode for tracking hardcopy of documents.	 	\n \nSignificance of the Study	 	\n 	The  significance  of  the  web	-based  application	 (EDMS)	 will  be  to  offer  great 	\nconvenience to the student’s submitting their manuscript. It giv	es them lesser amount 	\nof  effort,	 conserve  their  time  and  energy	 by  letting  them  upload  their  manuscript 	\nanywhere  they  want	. As  for  the  admin  side  it  will  hasten  the  sea	rch  of  research 	\nmaterials 	since	 all  the manuscripts  uploaded are  cat	egorize/segregated accordingly	, 	\nalso with the use of barcode they will be able to track the documents barrowed.	 	\n 	With the use of EDMS it will help reduce overhead of staff time and	 acceler	ate 	\nflow of information since everything is done electronically.	 EDMS will provide	 a more 	\ncompact means of storage	 and higher levels of data security and privacy.\n\n3 	\n \nConceptual Framework	 	\n 	\nFigure 1	: Conceptual Paradigm	 	\n 	\n 	Figure 1 shows the conceptual 	paradigm in developing an Electronic Document 	\nManagement System. Those who	 will	 access the website will be directed to the server 	\nwhich is connected to the database locally and all the data provided in the file system \nwill  be  viewed.  With  this,  all 	operati	on  will  be  made  easy  from  the  user  up  until  the 	\nadministrator’s side.	 	\n \nScope and Limitations of the project	  	\n 	The EDMS will be intended to the users to upload and inquire for manuscripts. 	\nIt will have the ability to search for keyword(s) inside the 	manuscript and return the title 	\nand abstract containing the keyword(s). The users of the system can be anybody as \nlong  as  registered  in  the  website.  All  details  on  the  website  will  be  provided  by  the \nadministrator on the server side.	 	\n 	The users must 	have a	n account in the website in order to search for research 	\nmaterials. 	The EDMS will employ a search	-engine style of searching for not only exact 	\nmatches but for relevant documents as well. 	Only the title and abstract will be provided 	\nto  the  users,  obtaining 	the  whole  manuscript  will  need  to  have  the  author’s 	\nauthorization.  There  will  be  no  downloading  involved  during  the  whole  process,  all \nmanuscripts or research material must be claimed at the CMU Research office along \nwith the authorization of the author.	 The hard copy of the manuscript will be provided\n\n4 	\n \nwith  a 	barcode;	 the  barcode  will  be	 scanned  by  a  barcode  scanner 	in  order  to 	\ndetermine if the manuscript is being barrowed or is within the Research office.	 On the 	\nuploading  of  manuscripts,  the  student  must  b	e  a  bona  fide  student  of  Central 	\nMindanao  University  and  must  have  completed  all  the  requirements  needed. 	When 	\nuploading the manuscript, the EDMS will automatically assign categories and tags for \nlesser human error.	 	\n 	Statistical  data  will  also  be  displayed	 by  the  web	-application,  this  will  include 	\nstatistical data of student’s course, college, study, and field.	 	\nThe student’s account will b	e coming from the existing data	base	 to access the 	\nwebsite. The existing database will be used by the researcher to develop the EDMS.	 	\nThe  manuscript’s  must  be  in  portable  document  format(PDF)  in  order  for  it  to 	\nbe uploaded.	 Checking of manuscript content for plagiarism will not be included i	n this 	\nstudy.\n\n5 	\n 	\nCHAPTER II	 	\nREVIEW OF RELATED LITERATURE	 	\n  	\nIn  common  language  the  word  document  usually  means  a  container  of 	\ninformation (usually on paper) containing written or drawn information for a particular \npurpose in structured way. Traditionally, a	 document is a piece of paper or a collection 	\nof papers, for instance, a memo, a letter, a mission statement or a customer invoice. \nCentral  to  the  idea  of  a  document  is  usually  that  it  can  be  easily  transferred,  stored \nand  handled  as  a  unit.  Over  the  last 	decade,  the  term  document  has  undergone  a 	\nradical  change  in  definition.  This  change  is partly  due  to  IT.  Thus  a  large  part  of  the \ndocuments handled in today’s business world are stored as individual computer files \nand  are  treaded  as  units  by  the  operating 	and  email  system	 (Life  Cycle  Document 	\nManagement System for Construction, n.d.)	 	\nWeb  application  usability  is  an  evolving  issue.  As  we  learn  more  and  more 	\nabout how our users interact with web application, how our users retrieve i	nformation 	\nand  use  it,  what  our  users  anticipate  within  their  realm  of  experiences,  we  can \niteratively improve our design and implementation	 (Wang, 2006)	. 	\nA  portal is a  system  that  serves  as  a  centralized  place  for accessing  d	ifferent 	\nresources in the Web (Atlantic Webfitters, 2014). It gathers information from different \nsources and put it all together in a single place which can help in accessing information \nby  several  users.  It  provides  the  users  with  a  single  point  of  conten	t,  data,  and 	\nservices. It can be personalized depending on the role of the user in the organization \n(Eldrandaly, 2009). There are different types of portal: general, community, horizontal, \nvertical,  enterprise,  personal,  and  niche.  Community  Portal  is  a  sy	stem  where  the 	\nusers are of same group of interests (Tatnall, 2005). 	 	\nElectronic document management solutions are designed to organize business 	\nfiles  and  records  digitally,  whether  they  started  out  in  paper form  or were  generated \nby  software  applications.	 Paper  files  are  first  converted  to  electronic  format  by 	\nscanning.  This  provides  a  more  compact  means  of  storage,  universal  access  for \nretrieval, and higher levels of data security and privacy	 (Easy Document Management: 	\nA Guide to B	enefits, Features, and Selection, 2011)	.\n\n6 	\n 	\nCodeigniter Development is one of the best PHP framework in web Application 	\nDevelopment. If a developer wished to develop an application in a better way, then the \nonly  option  is  web  development  with  framework.  As  compared  to  the  other \nframeworks,  Codeignit	er  Development  is  fast  and  reliable.  Its  time  and  speed  are 	\nsignificant.  The  developer  can  modify  (software)  for  use  on  a  different  machine  or \nplatform  for  existing  codes  by  using  PHP  framework.  PHP  server  side  scripting \nlanguage  is  very  useful,  In  PHP  sof	tware  development,  PHP  programming  or  PHP 	\napplication  development  or  outsourcing  PHP  is  used 	(What  is  Codeigniter  and  its 	\nadvantages, 2014)	. 	\nThere  are  a  lot  of  benefits  the  codeigniter framework can  offer. Aside from  its 	\nfast, 	reliable, lightweight and more capability. PHP helps in fixing errors on the system 	\neasily.  Through  this  framework,  developer  can  achieve  the  desired  specification  on \nthe developed system. Codeigniter Development can extend on PHP coding to get the \nspecifi	c functions through frameworks. In web Development, many features are almost 	\nthe  same  so  that  can  describe  the  same  code  in  different  way.  Codeigniter  PHP \nDevelopment is the easiest way to employ a program. It is compatible with most web \nservers,  numerous 	operating  systems  and  platforms.  This  framework  has  an 	\noutstanding  performance  and  it  is  famous  among  developer  especially  on  web \ndeveloping	 (Major  Benefits  of  Using  Codeigniter  PHP  Framework  Development, 	\n2016)	. \nPHP	 is one of 	the most popularly used languages for	 web development	 as well 	\nas	 web application development	. Reasons are 	it has 	Perfect Database Interaction:	  it 	\ncan  exchange  all  sorts  of  information  with  ease.  Another  reason  why	 PHP 	website 	\ndevelopment	 and	 web  developme	nt is  admired  by  developers  is  that	 PHP	 programs 	\nare free. Also, the database connectivity is less expensive as compared to that of other \nprograms  such  as  ASP  and  a  Microsoft  product  that  needs  to  be  purchased. \nHowever,	 web development with PHP	 through MyS	QL is free to use.	 PHP	 has also an 	\nupper hand when it comes to speed. This is mainly because, the	 PHP	 code runs faster 	\nas it runs in its own memory space	 (How is PHP used in Web Development, n.d.)	.\n\n7 	\n 	\nCHAPTER III	 	\nTECHNICAL 	BACKGROUND	 	\n \n HTML	 	\n 	Hypertext Mark	-up Language (	HTML) is a computer language devised to allow 	\nwebsite  creation.  These  websites  can  then  be  viewed  by  anyone  else  connected  to \nthe  internet.  It  is  relatively  easy  to  learn,  with  the  basics  being  accessible  to  m	ost 	\npeople in one session and it is quite powerful in what it allows the developer to create. \nIn  developing  a  website  HTML  is  handy.  HTML  codes  are  also  accessible  when  it \ncomes  to  the  coding  process  because  it  can  be  edited  through  Sublime  Text, \nProgramme	rs  Notepad  or  just  simply  a  notepad  editor.  Aside  that  it  helps  on  giving 	\nfunctionalities  on  the  program,  it  is  also  one  of  the  reason  why  designing  became \neasier 	(Shannon, 2012)	. 	\nPHP	 	 	\n 	PHP  Hypertext  Preprocessor  (PHP)  is  a 	widely	-used  open  source  general	-	\npurpose scripting language that is especially suited for web development and can be \nembedded  into  HTML.  PHP  is  also  a  powerful  tool  in  developing  an  interactive  and \ndynamic web page. The code developed in PHP can be executed	 on server and the 	\nresult  is  turned  to  the  browser  as  plain  HTML.  There  are  a  lot  of  things  that  PHP  is \ncapable of doing such as generating dynamic page content, collecting and encrypting \ndata and can be used to control user	-access	 (W	hat is PHP?, n.d.)	. 	\nCodeigniter	 	\n 	CodeIgniter	 comes in the Model	-View	-Controller (MVC) framework. This helps 	\nin changing 	various innovative and descriptive concepts that the users may come up 	\nwith. By usi	ng this framework,	 those concepts	 can be changed	 to actual applications. 	\nAs a developer, PHP codeigniter is	 significant for	 its simplicity	 and effective	ness	. The 	\nbiggest benefit of using CodeIgniter is that 	it can create web solutions t	hat offer a level 	\nof  proficiency	.  This  way, 	it  also 	provide	s effecti	ve  services  to  users.  Such  all	-round 	\nbenefits  are  rarely  found  in  other  frameworks.	 The  quality  of  libraries  that 	can 	be 	\naccess	ed in	 codeigniter framework development is so rich that 	it will meet all needed\n\n8 	\n \nfunctionalities  in  developing  a  system  such  as  up	loads,  cart  and  many  more	 (The 	\nbenefits of using CodeIgniter for web development, 2016)	. 	\nCSS	 	\n 	Cascading Style S	heet (CSS) is a Web page derived from multiple sources with 	\na defined order of precedence where the definitio	ns of 	any style element	. CSS saves 	\na  lot  of  work.  It  can  control  the  layout  of  multiple  pages  all  at  once.  With  the  use 	of 	\nCSS, it can change the layout of the whole H	TML design. It can also be used 	to define 	\nstyles for web pages, including the design, layout an	d variations in display for different 	\ndevices  and  screen  sizes.	 CSS  gives  more  control  over  the  appearance  of  a  Web 	\npage to the page creator than to the browser designer or the viewer.	 (Rouse, n.d.)	 	\nMySQL	 	\n 	MySQL  is  the  world\'s 	most  popular  open  source  database.  With  its  proven 	\nperf	ormance, reliability and usability.	 MySQL has become the leading database choice 	\nfor  web	-based 	applications	. Oracle  drives  MySQL  innovation,  delivering  new 	\ncapabilities to power next generation web, 	cloud, mobile and embedded applications.	 	\nUsing MySQL lets the system access and manipulate database easily 	(About MySQL, 	\nn.d.)	. 	\nBootstrap	 	\n 	Bootstrap  makes  front	-end  web  dev	elopment  faster  and  easier.  It  is	 made  for 	\npeople  of  all  skill  levels,  devices  of  all  shapes,  and  projects  of  all  sizes.	 It 	\ncontains	 HTML	- and	 CSS	-based  design  templates	 for	 typography	,  forms,  buttons, 	\nnavigation and other interface components, as well as optional	 JavaScript	 ext	ensions. 	\nWith  Bootstrap, 	developer  could	 get  extensive  and  beautiful  documentation  for 	\ncommon  HTML  elements,  dozens  of  custom  HTML  and  CSS  components,  and \nawesome jQuery plugins	. It gives the ability to easily create responsive designs. It is 	\neasy to use, 	has a responsive features it is also a b	rowser compatible	 (bootstrap, n.d.)	.\n\n9 	\n \nAJAX	 \nAjax  has  a 	method  of  exchanging  data  with  a  server,  and  updating  parts  of  a 	\nweb  page 	– witho	ut  reloading  the  entire  page. 	Ajax  is  used  to  perform	 a  callback, 	\nmaking a quick round trip to and from the server to retrieve and/or save data without \nposting the entire page back to the server.	 Ajax allows to make asynchronous calls to 	\na web server. This allows the client browser to avoid waiting for all d	ata to arrive before 	\nallowing  the  user  to  act  once  more.  Ajax  enabled  applications  will  always  be  more \nresponsive, faster and more user	-friendly.	 Ajax helps improve the speed, performance 	\nand usability of a web application	 (Segue, 20	13)	. 	\nJAVASCRIPT	 	\n 	Java  Script	 is a  programming  language  designed  specifically  for  electronic 	\ndocuments on the World Wide Web. JavaScript programs are embedded within HTML \nto add dynamic 	interactivity to web documents. JavaScript help in giving 	functionality 	\non an HTML file without difficulty in a	 full programming language	. A simple JavaScript 	\nprogram can add interesting interactive functions to a web page. It makes use of the \nuser  interface  mechanisms  already  in  HTML  to  interact  with  users  of  th	e  web 	\ndocument	. JavaScript cannot make 	a netwo	rk connection	 on its own, it 	is run by most 	\nmodern  browsers.  It 	can  be  developed  in  an	 object	-oriented  programming  and 	\nprocedural programming	 approach	 (Machajewski, n.d.)	. 	\nNAVICAT	 	\n Navicat is one of the solution in developing MySQL/MariaDB because it allows 	\nsimultaneous connection to the databases. It provides a	 natural and powerful graphical 	\ninterface  for  database  management,  development,  and  maintenance.	 It  would  be 	\neasier for the	 developer to  change  specific script  since  it  is easy  and fast  to  migrate 	\nall  needed  data. 	Navicat	 is also	 useful	 when	 it comes	 to transferring	 data	 to a database	 	\nbecause	 it supports	 export	ing	 data from tables, views, or query results to formats 	like Excel	, 	\nAccess, CSV,	 Add, modify, and delete records	. It also gives the tools 	need	ed to manage 	data 	\nefficien	tly and ensure a smooth process. Navicat e	stablish	ed	 secure connections through SSH 	\ntunneling  and  SSL  ensure	s every  connection  is  secure	d,  stable,  and 	reliable.  It  s	upport	s 	\ndifferent authentication methods of database ser	vers such as PAM authentication	 (Navicat for 	\nMySQL, n.d.)	.\n\n10	 	\n \nXAMPP	 \nXAMPP stands for Cross	-Platform (X), Apache (A), MariaDB (M), PHP (P) and 	\nPerl (P).	 It is a si	mple, lightweight Apache distribution that makes it extremely easy for 	\ndevelopers  to  create  a  local  web  server  for  testing  and  deployment  purposes. \nEverything  needed  to  set  up  a  web  server 	– server  application  (Apache),  database 	\n(MariaDB), and scripting la	nguage (PHP) 	– is included in an extractable file.	 XAMPP 	\nis  used  for  offline  modification  of  the  system.  Through  connecting  the  database  in \nnavicat, the system can be accessed easily and can be modified 	(Jangid, 2016)	. 	\nBarcode	 	\n 	Barcodes  are  used  in  the  business  process,  procedures  are  automated  to 	\nincrease produ	ctivity and reduce human error. 	Whenever there is a need to accurately 	\nidentify  or  track  something,  bar	-coding  should  be  used.  For example,  in a data entry 	\nwork 	environment, workers may be required to enter an enormous amount of data into 	\na  customer  database  system.  Instead  of  manually  typing  a  customer  identification \nnumber  into  a  database,  if  the  information  is  contained  in  a  barcode,  a  data  entry \noperator  may  s	can  it  in.  This  would  increase  au	tomation  and  reduce  human  error	 	\n(Barcode for Beginners, 2007)	.\n\n11	 	\n 	\nIdentify Objectives	 	\nand Information	 	\nRequirement	 	\n 	\nRequirement Planning	 	\nRAD De	sign Workshop	 	\nWork with Users \nto Design System	 	\n 	\nBuild the 	 	\nSystem	 	\n 	\nIntroduce the	 	\nNew System	 	\n 	\nImplementation	 	\nCHAPTER IV	 	\nMETHODOLOGY	 	\n 	\n 	This  ar	ea  discusses  the  methodology  that	 will  be  used  in  designing  the 	\nElectronic  Document  Management 	System  of  Central  Mindanao  University’s 	\nResearch Office.	 	\n \nDevelopment Methodology	 	\n \n \n \n \n \n 	 	\n 	\nFigure 3: 	The Rapid Application Development diagram	 	\n 	 	 	\n 	The	 Rapid Application Development	 (RAD)	 model is based on prototyping and 	\niterative  development  with  no  specific  planning  involved.  The  process  of  writing 	the 	\nsoftware itself involves the planning required for developing the product.	 	\nRAD	 focuses on gathering customer requirements through workshops or focus 	\ngroups, early testing of the prototypes by the customer using iterative concept, reuse \nof the existing 	prototypes (components), continuous integration and rapid delivery.	 	\nRAD is also a	 software development methodology that uses minimal planning 	\nin  favor  of  rapid  prototyping.  A  prototype  is  a  working  model  that  is  functionally \nequivalent to a component of th	e product.\n\n12	 	\n \nRequirements Planning	 	\nThe  developer  will  plan  the  whole  duration  in  developing  the  system.  From 	\ngathering  requirements,  coding  process,  system  test,  alpha  test,  bug  fixes, \nimprovements, final fixes and lastly the deployment.	 	\nThe  developer  will  do  some  data  gathering  through  Interviews.  In  the 	\nrequirements  planning  phase,  the  developer  will  conduct  interviews  with  the  staff  of \nCMU 	– Research office. After the interview and discussion, objectives will be identified 	\nand  the  infor	mation  needed  will  be  taken. 	The  developer 	will  do	 some  research  on 	\nwhat  type  of  system  should  be  used  in  order  to  help  enhance  the  whole  process  in \nuploading  and  searching  on  the  organization	. An  electronic  document  management 	\nsystem will be developed bas	ed on the interview.	  	\n 	CMU	-Research  office	 current  system  are  done  manuall	y. An  Excel	 database 	\nwas  involved  in  the  current  system  of  the  CMU	-Research  Office	.  On  the  current 	\nsystem  of  the  CMU	-Research  office	,  the  user  must  go  to  their  building  in  order  to 	\nsubmit their manuscript, also researchers must also go to the research office to look \nfor research materials therefore  research personnel’s 	will  try  to  find  the  materials o	n 	\nthe  file  to  look  for  the  topic	.  Although  the  process  is  that  simple,  it  would  be  ti	me 	\nconsuming for the 	personnel to look for the topic 	without assurance that the 	research 	\nis available. 	 	\nOn the design system, the user will register their account to be able to 	search 	\nfor  research  materials  online	.  Once  registered,  all  available 	manuscript	 titles  and 	\nabstract	 will be viewed. 	In uploading the manuscript, the student will need to use the 	\ncredentials stored in the existing database	. It will be verified by the server 	if the student 	\nhas completed all the requirement prior to the submission of ma	nuscript	. If 	the student 	\nhas not yet completed the requirements the system will mark the uploaded manuscript \n“In  progress”	.  If  the 	student  has  completed  the  requirements  the  system  will  then 	\nprovide the student with Research Number and will be mark with “O	K”.	 	\n 	The  designed  system  provides  convenience  to  the  user  because  they  will  no 	\nlonger be inquiring at the CMU	-Research office	 just to 	submit their manuscript also the 	\nresearch office personnel will no longer have to look over a lot of paper to look for the	 	\nresearch  material  needed.	 Unlike  the  current  system  where  they  have  to  personally\n\n13	 	\n \nsearch	 thus  consuming	 time	. This  is one  of  the  reasons  why  the  designed  system  is 	\nmuch helpful and convenient on the 	CMU	-Research office personnel.	 	\nUser Design	 	\n During  this 	phase,  the  developer  will  creat	e a  prototype  that  represent  all 	\nsystem process, inputs and outputs on the EDMS. As for the design of the system, the \ndevelo	per  will  use	 Bootstrap,  HTML,  CSS  and  JS  framework  for  it  to  be  responsive 	\nwhich can be viewed in any end devices like smartph	ones and tablets. The database 	\nsystem  used  in  the  project  will	 be	 MySQL  and  SQL  server  together  with  Navicat 	\nMySQL.  Navicat  is  a  software  for 	database  management.  In  order  to  access  the 	\ndatabase, the developer will use Codeigniter for it to function according to its process.	 	\nIn order to elaborate the whole process of the developed system, the developer 	\nwill create a context diagram. The context 	diagram will show that the user will input its 	\ncredentials.  The  administrator will then  manage  the  transactions made  by  the  online \nsystem. 	 	\n 	In  order  to  identify  the  functional features  that  will  be  added  to  the  developed	 	\nsystem,  a use  case  diagram 	will be	 designed.  All  actions  that the user can  do  in  the 	\nweb	-based  application 	will  be	 shown  in  the  figure.  The  user  of  the  system 	will	 be 	\nresearchers	, CMU	-Research office	 and 	the student	s of CMU.	 	\nThe  developer	 will  conduct  an  interview  and  will  mak	e  some  resear	ches  with 	\nCentral  Mindanao  University	-Research  office  personnel	 	and  management. 	\nInformation about the organization’s needs 	will be	 taken. After the conducted research, 	\nthe  developer	 will  design  a  system  that  will	 meet  the organization’s needs.  An  entity 	\nrelationship diagram 	will be	 created to represent the flow	. 	\n 	A  data  di	ctionar	y will  show	 the  description  of  the  fields  used  in  the  system.  It 	\nwill show	 what field and type of data 	will be	 used. 	 	\nConstruction	 	\n Durin	g  the 	development  of  the  system,  the  developer  will  gather  some 	\ninformation on what is best to use in developing a web	-based system. With these, the 	\ndeveloper  will  use  C	odeigniter  as  its  framework.  The  system  will  be  developed  with\n\n14	 	\n \nPHP, HTML, CSS and other	 programming languages that is necessary in fulfilling the 	\nneeds of the	 system. Also, with the use of C	odeigniter the development stage will be 	\nmade easier. With the help of its built	-in libraries and other functionalities such as add 	\nto cart, upload and c	onstructors. The developer will use procedural and object oriented 	\nprogramming approach on the coding process. There are also different structures that \nwill use like Statements (if) and Loop (foreach) in conditioning the codes.  	 	\n 	 In  developing  the	 system	 there  are  tools  that  will  be	 used.    For  the  user 	\ninterface,  the  developer 	will  use	 HTM	L,  CSS  and  bootstrap.  HTML  provides  the 	\ngraphical  interface  of  the  system  such  as  buttons,  inputs,  checkbox, 	attributes	 and 	\nmany more. CSS was used 	to quickly create lay	outs, and troubleshoot any problems 	\nwhen designing a website. Bootstrap 	will be use	 for the system to be responsive. For 	\nthe back end of the system, the developer 	will use	 PHP, Codeigniter Framework and 	\nAjax. 	PHP generates dynamic page content and it also allows to store and fetch data 	\non the database. 	Co	deigniter will help the developer 	develop a system in a simple way 	\nwith the help of its built	-in functions and constructors. 	Ajax 	will be use	 for the system 	\nto	 be more responsive, faster and more user	-friendly. Other tools such as Navicat and 	\nXAMPP 	will	 also	 be use	d for connectivity and access to the database used.	 	\nSoftware Requirements	 	\n 	Software  requirements  in  building  the  system  will  be  browsers  like  Google 	\nChrome, Firefox, Safari, Internet Explorer and Opera Mini. Also, Sublime Text Editor, \nFileZilla (version 3.20.1 or later), Navicat (version 10.0.6 or later). 	 	\nHardware Requirements	 	\n 	The minimum requirements in developing the system are at least Intel Pentium 	\n4  or  newer  processor  that  support  SSE2  and  512MB  of  Random  Access  Memory \n(RAM).	  	\nImplementation	 	\nAs soon as the aspects on	 the systems are built and refined, the new systems 	\nor par	t of systems are tested and then introduced to the organization. Because RAD 	\ncan be used to create new ecommerce applications for which there is no old system, \nthere  is  often  no  need  to  run  the  old  and  new  systems  in  parallel  before \nimplementation.\n\n15	 	\n \nTesting	 	\n 	During  the  testing  phase  of  the  system,  the  developer 	will  conduct	 an  Alpha 	\nand  Beta  testing.	 An  alpha  test  is  a  preliminary  software  field  test  carried  out  by 	the 	\ndeveloper 	in order to find bugs that were not found previously through other tests. The 	\nmain purpose of alpha testing is to refine t	he software product by finding and fixing 	the 	\nbugs that were not discovered through previous tests	 (Alpha Test, n.d.)	. Alpha testing 	\nwill be	 done by the developer to test whether all features are functionally capable. The 	\ndeveloper 	will also explore	 capabilities of the whole system. It is usually done during 	\nthe whole process of developing the system.	 A beta testing is when	 applications are 	\nsu	bjected to real world testing by the intended 	user	 for the 	website	. In the Beta testing, 	\nother  personnel  like  CMU  students 	will	 test  the  system.  Users  who  are  new  to  the 	\nsystem will be using it and will determine if the system is	 suitable for the organizat	ion. 	\nBeta testing is done in order to know if the system is useful to the organization. In this \ntest, the developer will know the features on the system that need improvements.	 	\nSoftware Requirements	 	\n 	In  the  implementation  phase,  the  minimum  software  requirements  are  web 	\nbrowsers such as Google Chrome (version 3.0.195 or later), Mozilla Firefox (version \n54.0.1  or  later),  Opera  Mini  (version  11.52),  Safari  (version  4.0.3  for  Mac  OS  and \nversion 4.0 for Wi	ndows X or later), Internet Explorer Edge (version 21.10547 or later). 	 	\n Hardware Requirement	 	\n 	For  the  hardware  minimum  requirements  are  internet  connected  end  devices 	\nsuch as tablets and smartphones capable to open the mentioned browsers.	 A barcode 	\nprinte	r and a barcode scanner using linear barcode (Code 128).	  	\nOperating System	 	\n 	As  for  the  operating  system  the  website  can  be  opened  through  mobile  or 	\ndesktop. For desktop, it must be at least a Windows XP or later. As for the mobile, it \nmust be at least a 	gingerbread 2.3.7 for android and IOS 8.', '2018-06-28 05:54:58', '2018-06-28 05:54:58');

Moreover, EDMS provides a more compact means of storage, universal 	\naccess for retrieval, and higher levels of data security and privacy.	 	\n 	The process of EDMS has to do with capturing, storing, indexing and retrieval. 	\nit improves the accessing of informatio	n by the users of the organization wherein they 	\ncan  easily  search  and  retrieve  the  documents  needed.  Also,  there will  be  security  in \nsuch  a  way  that  the  only  authorized  users  are  allowed  to  access  the  particular \ndocuments. 	 	\n \nProject Context	 	\n 	Central  Mindan	ao  University 	– Research  office  is  responsible 	for  signing  of 	\nthesis/dissertation,  thesis  manuscripts,  routinely  requests  and  advising  on  research \nstatistics/data  analysis.

With this, the developer will work to create an EDMS that \nwill save and manage the student’s manuscripts.	 The web application will be expected 	\nto give users a new experience in interacting with the	 said EDMS.	 	\n 	The development of such web application will help users look for the research 	\nmaterials they’re lookin	g. Transactions will be done through online from uploading of 	\nmanuscripts and searching for possible research material. The web application w	ill be 	\neasy to use and accessible to all users.\n\n2 	\n \nObjectives of the Project	 	\n 	The  general	 objective	 of  this  project  is  to  design,  develop  and  implement  an 	\nElectronic Document Management System for Central Mindanao University Research \nOffice.	 	\n 	Specifically, t	he study aims to:	 	\n1. design a	nd create a	 database structure for record repository;	 	\n2. design a	nd create a	 website that is accessible and easy to use;	 	\n3. design and develop a web	-based application for document management;	 	\n4. allo	w uploading of documents online;	 	\n5. automatically 	assign categories and tags to uploaded documents;	 	\n6. employ barcode for tracking hardcopy of documents.	 	\n \nSignificance of the Study	 	\n 	The  significance  of  the  web	-based  application	 (EDMS)	 will  be  to  offer  great 	\nconvenience to the student’s submitting their manuscript. It giv	es them lesser amount 	\nof  effort,	 conserve  their  time  and  energy	 by  letting  them  upload  their  manuscript 	\nanywhere  they  want	. As  for  the  admin  side  it  will  hasten  the  sea	rch  of  research 	\nmaterials 	since	 all  the manuscripts  uploaded are  cat	egorize/segregated accordingly	, 	\nalso with the use of barcode they will be able to track the documents barrowed.	 	\n 	With the use of EDMS it will help reduce overhead of staff time and	 acceler	ate 	\nflow of information since everything is done electronically.	 EDMS will provide	 a more 	\ncompact means of storage	 and higher levels of data security and privacy.\n\n3 	\n \nConceptual Framework	 	\n 	\nFigure 1	: Conceptual Paradigm	 	\n 	\n 	Figure 1 shows the conceptual 	paradigm in developing an Electronic Document 	\nManagement System. Those who	 will	 access the website will be directed to the server 	\nwhich is connected to the database locally and all the data provided in the file system \nwill  be  viewed.  With  this,  all 	operati	on  will  be  made  easy  from  the  user  up  until  the 	\nadministrator’s side.	 	\n \nScope and Limitations of the project	  	\n 	The EDMS will be intended to the users to upload and inquire for manuscripts. 	\nIt will have the ability to search for keyword(s) inside the 	manuscript and return the title 	\nand abstract containing the keyword(s). The users of the system can be anybody as \nlong  as  registered  in  the  website.  All  details  on  the  website  will  be  provided  by  the \nadministrator on the server side.	 	\n 	The users must 	have a	n account in the website in order to search for research 	\nmaterials. 	The EDMS will employ a search	-engine style of searching for not only exact 	\nmatches but for relevant documents as well. 	Only the title and abstract will be provided 	\nto  the  users,  obtaining 	the  whole  manuscript  will  need  to  have  the  author’s 	\nauthorization.  There  will  be  no  downloading  involved  during  the  whole  process,  all \nmanuscripts or research material must be claimed at the CMU Research office along \nwith the authorization of the author.	 The hard copy of the manuscript will be provided\n\n4 	\n \nwith  a 	barcode;	 the  barcode  will  be	 scanned  by  a  barcode  scanner 	in  order  to 	\ndetermine if the manuscript is being barrowed or is within the Research office.	 On the 	\nuploading  of  manuscripts,  the  student  must  b	e  a  bona  fide  student  of  Central 	\nMindanao  University  and  must  have  completed  all  the  requirements  needed. 	When 	\nuploading the manuscript, the EDMS will automatically assign categories and tags for \nlesser human error.	 	\n 	Statistical  data  will  also  be  displayed	 by  the  web	-application,  this  will  include 	\nstatistical data of student’s course, college, study, and field.	 	\nThe student’s account will b	e coming from the existing data	base	 to access the 	\nwebsite. The existing database will be used by the researcher to develop the EDMS.	 	\nThe  manuscript’s  must  be  in  portable  document  format(PDF)  in  order  for  it  to 	\nbe uploaded.	 Checking of manuscript content for plagiarism will not be included i	n this 	\nstudy.\n\n5 	\n 	\nCHAPTER II	 	\nREVIEW OF RELATED LITERATURE	 	\n  	\nIn  common  language  the  word  document  usually  means  a  container  of 	\ninformation (usually on paper) containing written or drawn information for a particular \npurpose in structured way. Traditionally, a	 document is a piece of paper or a collection 	\nof papers, for instance, a memo, a letter, a mission statement or a customer invoice. \nCentral  to  the  idea  of  a  document  is  usually  that  it  can  be  easily  transferred,  stored \nand  handled  as  a  unit.  Over  the  last 	decade,  the  term  document  has  undergone  a 	\nradical  change  in  definition.  This  change  is partly  due  to  IT.  Thus  a  large  part  of  the \ndocuments handled in today’s business world are stored as individual computer files \nand  are  treaded  as  units  by  the  operating 	and  email  system	 (Life  Cycle  Document 	\nManagement System for Construction, n.d.)	 	\nWeb  application  usability  is  an  evolving  issue.  As  we  learn  more  and  more 	\nabout how our users interact with web application, how our users retrieve i	nformation 	\nand  use  it,  what  our  users  anticipate  within  their  realm  of  experiences,  we  can \niteratively improve our design and implementation	 (Wang, 2006)	. 	\nA  portal is a  system  that  serves  as  a  centralized  place  for accessing  d	ifferent 	\nresources in the Web (Atlantic Webfitters, 2014). It gathers information from different \nsources and put it all together in a single place which can help in accessing information \nby  several  users.  It  provides  the  users  with  a  single  point  of  conten	t,  data,  and 	\nservices. It can be personalized depending on the role of the user in the organization \n(Eldrandaly, 2009). There are different types of portal: general, community, horizontal, \nvertical,  enterprise,  personal,  and  niche.  Community  Portal  is  a  sy	stem  where  the 	\nusers are of same group of interests (Tatnall, 2005). 	 	\nElectronic document management solutions are designed to organize business 	\nfiles  and  records  digitally,  whether  they  started  out  in  paper form  or were  generated \nby  software  applications.	 Paper  files  are  first  converted  to  electronic  format  by 	\nscanning.  This  provides  a  more  compact  means  of  storage,  universal  access  for \nretrieval, and higher levels of data security and privacy	 (Easy Document Management: 	\nA Guide to B	enefits, Features, and Selection, 2011)	.\n\n6 	\n 	\nCodeigniter Development is one of the best PHP framework in web Application 	\nDevelopment. If a developer wished to develop an application in a better way, then the \nonly  option  is  web  development  with  framework.  As  compared  to  the  other \nframeworks,  Codeignit	er  Development  is  fast  and  reliable.  Its  time  and  speed  are 	\nsignificant.  The  developer  can  modify  (software)  for  use  on  a  different  machine  or \nplatform  for  existing  codes  by  using  PHP  framework.  PHP  server  side  scripting \nlanguage  is  very  useful,  In  PHP  sof	tware  development,  PHP  programming  or  PHP 	\napplication  development  or  outsourcing  PHP  is  used 	(What  is  Codeigniter  and  its 	\nadvantages, 2014)	. 	\nThere  are  a  lot  of  benefits  the  codeigniter framework can  offer. Aside from  its 	\nfast, 	reliable, lightweight and more capability. PHP helps in fixing errors on the system 	\neasily.  Through  this  framework,  developer  can  achieve  the  desired  specification  on \nthe developed system. Codeigniter Development can extend on PHP coding to get the \nspecifi	c functions through frameworks. In web Development, many features are almost 	\nthe  same  so  that  can  describe  the  same  code  in  different  way.  Codeigniter  PHP \nDevelopment is the easiest way to employ a program. It is compatible with most web \nservers,  numerous 	operating  systems  and  platforms.  This  framework  has  an 	\noutstanding  performance  and  it  is  famous  among  developer  especially  on  web \ndeveloping	 (Major  Benefits  of  Using  Codeigniter  PHP  Framework  Development, 	\n2016)	. \nPHP	 is one of 	the most popularly used languages for	 web development	 as well 	\nas	 web application development	. Reasons are 	it has 	Perfect Database Interaction:	  it 	\ncan  exchange  all  sorts  of  information  with  ease.  Another  reason  why	 PHP 	website 	\ndevelopment	 and	 web  developme	nt is  admired  by  developers  is  that	 PHP	 programs 	\nare free. Also, the database connectivity is less expensive as compared to that of other \nprograms  such  as  ASP  and  a  Microsoft  product  that  needs  to  be  purchased. \nHowever,	 web development with PHP	 through MyS	QL is free to use.	 PHP	 has also an 	\nupper hand when it comes to speed. This is mainly because, the	 PHP	 code runs faster 	\nas it runs in its own memory space	 (How is PHP used in Web Development, n.d.)	.\n\n7 	\n 	\nCHAPTER III	 	\nTECHNICAL 	BACKGROUND	 	\n \n HTML	 	\n 	Hypertext Mark	-up Language (	HTML) is a computer language devised to allow 	\nwebsite  creation.  These  websites  can  then  be  viewed  by  anyone  else  connected  to \nthe  internet.  It  is  relatively  easy  to  learn,  with  the  basics  being  accessible  to  m	ost 	\npeople in one session and it is quite powerful in what it allows the developer to create. \nIn  developing  a  website  HTML  is  handy.  HTML  codes  are  also  accessible  when  it \ncomes  to  the  coding  process  because  it  can  be  edited  through  Sublime  Text, \nProgramme	rs  Notepad  or  just  simply  a  notepad  editor.  Aside  that  it  helps  on  giving 	\nfunctionalities  on  the  program,  it  is  also  one  of  the  reason  why  designing  became \neasier 	(Shannon, 2012)	. 	\nPHP	 	 	\n 	PHP  Hypertext  Preprocessor  (PHP)  is  a 	widely	-used  open  source  general	-	\npurpose scripting language that is especially suited for web development and can be \nembedded  into  HTML.  PHP  is  also  a  powerful  tool  in  developing  an  interactive  and \ndynamic web page. The code developed in PHP can be executed	 on server and the 	\nresult  is  turned  to  the  browser  as  plain  HTML.  There  are  a  lot  of  things  that  PHP  is \ncapable of doing such as generating dynamic page content, collecting and encrypting \ndata and can be used to control user	-access	 (W	hat is PHP?, n.d.)	. 	\nCodeigniter	 	\n 	CodeIgniter	 comes in the Model	-View	-Controller (MVC) framework. This helps 	\nin changing 	various innovative and descriptive concepts that the users may come up 	\nwith. By usi	ng this framework,	 those concepts	 can be changed	 to actual applications. 	\nAs a developer, PHP codeigniter is	 significant for	 its simplicity	 and effective	ness	. The 	\nbiggest benefit of using CodeIgniter is that 	it can create web solutions t	hat offer a level 	\nof  proficiency	.  This  way, 	it  also 	provide	s effecti	ve  services  to  users.  Such  all	-round 	\nbenefits  are  rarely  found  in  other  frameworks.	 The  quality  of  libraries  that 	can 	be 	\naccess	ed in	 codeigniter framework development is so rich that 	it will meet all needed\n\n8 	\n \nfunctionalities  in  developing  a  system  such  as  up	loads,  cart  and  many  more	 (The 	\nbenefits of using CodeIgniter for web development, 2016)	. 	\nCSS	 	\n 	Cascading Style S	heet (CSS) is a Web page derived from multiple sources with 	\na defined order of precedence where the definitio	ns of 	any style element	. CSS saves 	\na  lot  of  work.  It  can  control  the  layout  of  multiple  pages  all  at  once.  With  the  use 	of 	\nCSS, it can change the layout of the whole H	TML design. It can also be used 	to define 	\nstyles for web pages, including the design, layout an	d variations in display for different 	\ndevices  and  screen  sizes.	 CSS  gives  more  control  over  the  appearance  of  a  Web 	\npage to the page creator than to the browser designer or the viewer.	 (Rouse, n.d.)	 	\nMySQL	 	\n 	MySQL  is  the  world\'s 	most  popular  open  source  database.  With  its  proven 	\nperf	ormance, reliability and usability.	 MySQL has become the leading database choice 	\nfor  web	-based 	applications	. Oracle  drives  MySQL  innovation,  delivering  new 	\ncapabilities to power next generation web, 	cloud, mobile and embedded applications.	 	\nUsing MySQL lets the system access and manipulate database easily 	(About MySQL, 	\nn.d.)	. 	\nBootstrap	 	\n 	Bootstrap  makes  front	-end  web  dev	elopment  faster  and  easier.  It  is	 made  for 	\npeople  of  all  skill  levels,  devices  of  all  shapes,  and  projects  of  all  sizes.	 It 	\ncontains	 HTML	- and	 CSS	-based  design  templates	 for	 typography	,  forms,  buttons, 	\nnavigation and other interface components, as well as optional	 JavaScript	 ext	ensions. 	\nWith  Bootstrap, 	developer  could	 get  extensive  and  beautiful  documentation  for 	\ncommon  HTML  elements,  dozens  of  custom  HTML  and  CSS  components,  and \nawesome jQuery plugins	. It gives the ability to easily create responsive designs. It is 	\neasy to use, 	has a responsive features it is also a b	rowser compatible	 (bootstrap, n.d.)	.\n\n9 	\n \nAJAX	 \nAjax  has  a 	method  of  exchanging  data  with  a  server,  and  updating  parts  of  a 	\nweb  page 	– witho	ut  reloading  the  entire  page. 	Ajax  is  used  to  perform	 a  callback, 	\nmaking a quick round trip to and from the server to retrieve and/or save data without \nposting the entire page back to the server.	 Ajax allows to make asynchronous calls to 	\na web server. This allows the client browser to avoid waiting for all d	ata to arrive before 	\nallowing  the  user  to  act  once  more.  Ajax  enabled  applications  will  always  be  more \nresponsive, faster and more user	-friendly.	 Ajax helps improve the speed, performance 	\nand usability of a web application	 (Segue, 20	13)	. 	\nJAVASCRIPT	 	\n 	Java  Script	 is a  programming  language  designed  specifically  for  electronic 	\ndocuments on the World Wide Web. JavaScript programs are embedded within HTML \nto add dynamic 	interactivity to web documents. JavaScript help in giving 	functionality 	\non an HTML file without difficulty in a	 full programming language	. A simple JavaScript 	\nprogram can add interesting interactive functions to a web page. It makes use of the \nuser  interface  mechanisms  already  in  HTML  to  interact  with  users  of  th	e  web 	\ndocument	. JavaScript cannot make 	a netwo	rk connection	 on its own, it 	is run by most 	\nmodern  browsers.  It 	can  be  developed  in  an	 object	-oriented  programming  and 	\nprocedural programming	 approach	 (Machajewski, n.d.)	. 	\nNAVICAT	 	\n Navicat is one of the solution in developing MySQL/MariaDB because it allows 	\nsimultaneous connection to the databases. It provides a	 natural and powerful graphical 	\ninterface  for  database  management,  development,  and  maintenance.	 It  would  be 	\neasier for the	 developer to  change  specific script  since  it  is easy  and fast  to  migrate 	\nall  needed  data. 	Navicat	 is also	 useful	 when	 it comes	 to transferring	 data	 to a database	 	\nbecause	 it supports	 export	ing	 data from tables, views, or query results to formats 	like Excel	, 	\nAccess, CSV,	 Add, modify, and delete records	. It also gives the tools 	need	ed to manage 	data 	\nefficien	tly and ensure a smooth process. Navicat e	stablish	ed	 secure connections through SSH 	\ntunneling  and  SSL  ensure	s every  connection  is  secure	d,  stable,  and 	reliable.  It  s	upport	s 	\ndifferent authentication methods of database ser	vers such as PAM authentication	 (Navicat for 	\nMySQL, n.d.)	.\n\n10	 	\n \nXAMPP	 \nXAMPP stands for Cross	-Platform (X), Apache (A), MariaDB (M), PHP (P) and 	\nPerl (P).	 It is a si	mple, lightweight Apache distribution that makes it extremely easy for 	\ndevelopers  to  create  a  local  web  server  for  testing  and  deployment  purposes. \nEverything  needed  to  set  up  a  web  server 	– server  application  (Apache),  database 	\n(MariaDB), and scripting la	nguage (PHP) 	– is included in an extractable file.	 XAMPP 	\nis  used  for  offline  modification  of  the  system.  Through  connecting  the  database  in \nnavicat, the system can be accessed easily and can be modified 	(Jangid, 2016)	. 	\nBarcode	 	\n 	Barcodes  are  used  in  the  business  process,  procedures  are  automated  to 	\nincrease produ	ctivity and reduce human error. 	Whenever there is a need to accurately 	\nidentify  or  track  something,  bar	-coding  should  be  used.  For example,  in a data entry 	\nwork 	environment, workers may be required to enter an enormous amount of data into 	\na  customer  database  system.  Instead  of  manually  typing  a  customer  identification \nnumber  into  a  database,  if  the  information  is  contained  in  a  barcode,  a  data  entry \noperator  may  s	can  it  in.  This  would  increase  au	tomation  and  reduce  human  error	 	\n(Barcode for Beginners, 2007)	.\n\n11	 	\n 	\nIdentify Objectives	 	\nand Information	 	\nRequirement	 	\n 	\nRequirement Planning	 	\nRAD De	sign Workshop	 	\nWork with Users \nto Design System	 	\n 	\nBuild the 	 	\nSystem	 	\n 	\nIntroduce the	 	\nNew System	 	\n 	\nImplementation	 	\nCHAPTER IV	 	\nMETHODOLOGY	 	\n 	\n 	This  ar	ea  discusses  the  methodology  that	 will  be  used  in  designing  the 	\nElectronic  Document  Management 	System  of  Central  Mindanao  University’s 	\nResearch Office.	 	\n \nDevelopment Methodology	 	\n \n \n \n \n \n 	 	\n 	\nFigure 3: 	The Rapid Application Development diagram	 	\n 	 	 	\n 	The	 Rapid Application Development	 (RAD)	 model is based on prototyping and 	\niterative  development  with  no  specific  planning  involved.  The  process  of  writing 	the 	\nsoftware itself involves the planning required for developing the product.	 	\nRAD	 focuses on gathering customer requirements through workshops or focus 	\ngroups, early testing of the prototypes by the customer using iterative concept, reuse \nof the existing 	prototypes (components), continuous integration and rapid delivery.	 	\nRAD is also a	 software development methodology that uses minimal planning 	\nin  favor  of  rapid  prototyping.  A  prototype  is  a  working  model  that  is  functionally \nequivalent to a component of th	e product.\n\n12	 	\n \nRequirements Planning	 	\nThe  developer  will  plan  the  whole  duration  in  developing  the  system.  From 	\ngathering  requirements,  coding  process,  system  test,  alpha  test,  bug  fixes, \nimprovements, final fixes and lastly the deployment.	 	\nThe  developer  will  do  some  data  gathering  through  Interviews.  In  the 	\nrequirements  planning  phase,  the  developer  will  conduct  interviews  with  the  staff  of \nCMU 	– Research office. After the interview and discussion, objectives will be identified 	\nand  the  infor	mation  needed  will  be  taken. 	The  developer 	will  do	 some  research  on 	\nwhat  type  of  system  should  be  used  in  order  to  help  enhance  the  whole  process  in \nuploading  and  searching  on  the  organization	. An  electronic  document  management 	\nsystem will be developed bas	ed on the interview.	  	\n 	CMU	-Research  office	 current  system  are  done  manuall	y. An  Excel	 database 	\nwas  involved  in  the  current  system  of  the  CMU	-Research  Office	.  On  the  current 	\nsystem  of  the  CMU	-Research  office	,  the  user  must  go  to  their  building  in  order  to 	\nsubmit their manuscript, also researchers must also go to the research office to look \nfor research materials therefore  research personnel’s 	will  try  to  find  the  materials o	n 	\nthe  file  to  look  for  the  topic	.  Although  the  process  is  that  simple,  it  would  be  ti	me 	\nconsuming for the 	personnel to look for the topic 	without assurance that the 	research 	\nis available. 	 	\nOn the design system, the user will register their account to be able to 	search 	\nfor  research  materials  online	.  Once  registered,  all  available 	manuscript	 titles  and 	\nabstract	 will be viewed. 	In uploading the manuscript, the student will need to use the 	\ncredentials stored in the existing database	. It will be verified by the server 	if the student 	\nhas completed all the requirement prior to the submission of ma	nuscript	. If 	the student 	\nhas not yet completed the requirements the system will mark the uploaded manuscript \n“In  progress”	.  If  the 	student  has  completed  the  requirements  the  system  will  then 	\nprovide the student with Research Number and will be mark with “O	K”.	 	\n 	The  designed  system  provides  convenience  to  the  user  because  they  will  no 	\nlonger be inquiring at the CMU	-Research office	 just to 	submit their manuscript also the 	\nresearch office personnel will no longer have to look over a lot of paper to look for the	 	\nresearch  material  needed.	 Unlike  the  current  system  where  they  have  to  personally\n\n13	 	\n \nsearch	 thus  consuming	 time	. This  is one  of  the  reasons  why  the  designed  system  is 	\nmuch helpful and convenient on the 	CMU	-Research office personnel.	 	\nUser Design	 	\n During  this 	phase,  the  developer  will  creat	e a  prototype  that  represent  all 	\nsystem process, inputs and outputs on the EDMS. As for the design of the system, the \ndevelo	per  will  use	 Bootstrap,  HTML,  CSS  and  JS  framework  for  it  to  be  responsive 	\nwhich can be viewed in any end devices like smartph	ones and tablets. The database 	\nsystem  used  in  the  project  will	 be	 MySQL  and  SQL  server  together  with  Navicat 	\nMySQL.  Navicat  is  a  software  for 	database  management.  In  order  to  access  the 	\ndatabase, the developer will use Codeigniter for it to function according to its process.	 	\nIn order to elaborate the whole process of the developed system, the developer 	\nwill create a context diagram. The context 	diagram will show that the user will input its 	\ncredentials.  The  administrator will then  manage  the  transactions made  by  the  online \nsystem. 	 	\n 	In  order  to  identify  the  functional features  that  will  be  added  to  the  developed	 	\nsystem,  a use  case  diagram 	will be	 designed.  All  actions  that the user can  do  in  the 	\nweb	-based  application 	will  be	 shown  in  the  figure.  The  user  of  the  system 	will	 be 	\nresearchers	, CMU	-Research office	 and 	the student	s of CMU.	 	\nThe  developer	 will  conduct  an  interview  and  will  mak	e  some  resear	ches  with 	\nCentral  Mindanao  University	-Research  office  personnel	 	and  management. 	\nInformation about the organization’s needs 	will be	 taken. After the conducted research, 	\nthe  developer	 will  design  a  system  that  will	 meet  the organization’s needs.  An  entity 	\nrelationship diagram 	will be	 created to represent the flow	. 	\n 	A  data  di	ctionar	y will  show	 the  description  of  the  fields  used  in  the  system.  It 	\nwill show	 what field and type of data 	will be	 used. 	 	\nConstruction	 	\n Durin	g  the 	development  of  the  system,  the  developer  will  gather  some 	\ninformation on what is best to use in developing a web	-based system. With these, the 	\ndeveloper  will  use  C	odeigniter  as  its  framework.  The  system  will  be  developed  with\n\n14	 	\n \nPHP, HTML, CSS and other	 programming languages that is necessary in fulfilling the 	\nneeds of the	 system. Also, with the use of C	odeigniter the development stage will be 	\nmade easier. With the help of its built	-in libraries and other functionalities such as add 	\nto cart, upload and c	onstructors. The developer will use procedural and object oriented 	\nprogramming approach on the coding process. There are also different structures that \nwill use like Statements (if) and Loop (foreach) in conditioning the codes.  	 	\n 	 In  developing  the	 system	 there  are  tools  that  will  be	 used.    For  the  user 	\ninterface,  the  developer 	will  use	 HTM	L,  CSS  and  bootstrap.  HTML  provides  the 	\ngraphical  interface  of  the  system  such  as  buttons,  inputs,  checkbox, 	attributes	 and 	\nmany more. CSS was used 	to quickly create lay	outs, and troubleshoot any problems 	\nwhen designing a website. Bootstrap 	will be use	 for the system to be responsive. For 	\nthe back end of the system, the developer 	will use	 PHP, Codeigniter Framework and 	\nAjax. 	PHP generates dynamic page content and it also allows to store and fetch data 	\non the database. 	Co	deigniter will help the developer 	develop a system in a simple way 	\nwith the help of its built	-in functions and constructors. 	Ajax 	will be use	 for the system 	\nto	 be more responsive, faster and more user	-friendly. Other tools such as Navicat and 	\nXAMPP 	will	 also	 be use	d for connectivity and access to the database used.	 	\nSoftware Requirements	 	\n 	Software  requirements  in  building  the  system  will  be  browsers  like  Google 	\nChrome, Firefox, Safari, Internet Explorer and Opera Mini. Also, Sublime Text Editor, \nFileZilla (version 3.20.1 or later), Navicat (version 10.0.6 or later). 	 	\nHardware Requirements	 	\n 	The minimum requirements in developing the system are at least Intel Pentium 	\n4  or  newer  processor  that  support  SSE2  and  512MB  of  Random  Access  Memory \n(RAM).	  	\nImplementation	 	\nAs soon as the aspects on	 the systems are built and refined, the new systems 	\nor par	t of systems are tested and then introduced to the organization. Because RAD 	\ncan be used to create new ecommerce applications for which there is no old system, \nthere  is  often  no  need  to  run  the  old  and  new  systems  in  parallel  before \nimplementation.\n\n15	 	\n \nTesting	 	\n 	During  the  testing  phase  of  the  system,  the  developer 	will  conduct	 an  Alpha 	\nand  Beta  testing.	 An  alpha  test  is  a  preliminary  software  field  test  carried  out  by 	the 	\ndeveloper 	in order to find bugs that were not found previously through other tests. The 	\nmain purpose of alpha testing is to refine t	he software product by finding and fixing 	the 	\nbugs that were not discovered through previous tests	 (Alpha Test, n.d.)	. Alpha testing 	\nwill be	 done by the developer to test whether all features are functionally capable. The 	\ndeveloper 	will also explore	 capabilities of the whole system. It is usually done during 	\nthe whole process of developing the system.	 A beta testing is when	 applications are 	\nsu	bjected to real world testing by the intended 	user	 for the 	website	. In the Beta testing, 	\nother  personnel  like  CMU  students 	will	 test  the  system.  Users  who  are  new  to  the 	\nsystem will be using it and will determine if the system is	 suitable for the organizat	ion. 	\nBeta testing is done in order to know if the system is useful to the organization. In this \ntest, the developer will know the features on the system that need improvements.	 	\nSoftware Requirements	 	\n 	In  the  implementation  phase,  the  minimum  software  requirements  are  web 	\nbrowsers such as Google Chrome (version 3.0.195 or later), Mozilla Firefox (version \n54.0.1  or  later),  Opera  Mini  (version  11.52),  Safari  (version  4.0.3  for  Mac  OS  and \nversion 4.0 for Wi	ndows X or later), Internet Explorer Edge (version 21.10547 or later). 	 	\n Hardware Requirement	 	\n 	For  the  hardware  minimum  requirements  are  internet  connected  end  devices 	\nsuch as tablets and smartphones capable to open the mentioned browsers.	 A barcode 	\nprinte	r and a barcode scanner using linear barcode (Code 128).	  	\nOperating System	 	\n 	As  for  the  operating  system  the  website  can  be  opened  through  mobile  or 	\ndesktop. For desktop, it must be at least a Windows XP or later. As for the mobile, it \nmust be at least a 	gingerbread 2.3.7 for android and IOS 8.', '2018-06-28 06:54:43', '2018-06-28 06:54:43');

Moreover, EDMS provides a more compact means of storage, universal 	\naccess for retrieval, and higher levels of data security and privacy.	 	\n 	The process of EDMS has to do with capturing, storing, indexing and retrieval. 	\nit improves the accessing of informatio	n by the users of the organization wherein they 	\ncan  easily  search  and  retrieve  the  documents  needed.  Also,  there will  be  security  in \nsuch  a  way  that  the  only  authorized  users  are  allowed  to  access  the  particular \ndocuments. 	 	\n \nProject Context	 	\n 	Central  Mindan	ao  University 	– Research  office  is  responsible 	for  signing  of 	\nthesis/dissertation,  thesis  manuscripts,  routinely  requests  and  advising  on  research \nstatistics/data  analysis.  Services  made  by  the  office  is  done  manually,  daily \ntransactions  are  written  or  enc	oded  and  stored  in  one  place  which  cause  them 	\ndifficulties in tracking information or data in a specific date. 	 	\n \nPurpose and Description	 	\n 	Developing  an  EDMS  would  make  the	 Research  office  services  more 	\npresentable and convenient. With this, the developer will work to create an EDMS that \nwill save and manage the student’s manuscripts.	 The web application will be expected 	\nto give users a new experience in interacting with the	 said EDMS.	 	\n 	The development of such web application will help users look for the research 	\nmaterials they’re lookin	g. Transactions will be done through online from uploading of 	\nmanuscripts and searching for possible research material. The web application w	ill be 	\neasy to use and accessible to all users.\n\n2 	\n \nObjectives of the Project	 	\n 	The  general	 objective	 of  this  project  is  to  design,  develop  and  implement  an 	\nElectronic Document Management System for Central Mindanao University Research \nOffice.	 	\n 	Specifically, t	he study aims to:	 	\n1. design a	nd create a	 database structure for record repository;	 	\n2. design a	nd create a	 website that is accessible and easy to use;	 	\n3. design and develop a web	-based application for document management;	 	\n4. allo	w uploading of documents online;	 	\n5. automatically 	assign categories and tags to uploaded documents;	 	\n6. employ barcode for tracking hardcopy of documents.	 	\n \nSignificance of the Study	 	\n 	The  significance  of  the  web	-based  application	 (EDMS)	 will  be  to  offer  great 	\nconvenience to the student’s submitting their manuscript. It giv	es them lesser amount 	\nof  effort,	 conserve  their  time  and  energy	 by  letting  them  upload  their  manuscript 	\nanywhere  they  want	. As  for  the  admin  side  it  will  hasten  the  sea	rch  of  research 	\nmaterials 	since	 all  the manuscripts  uploaded are  cat	egorize/segregated accordingly	, 	\nalso with the use of barcode they will be able to track the documents barrowed.	 	\n 	With the use of EDMS it will help reduce overhead of staff time and	 acceler	ate 	\nflow of information since everything is done electronically.	 EDMS will provide	 a more 	\ncompact means of storage	 and higher levels of data security and privacy.\n\n3 	\n \nConceptual Framework	 	\n 	\nFigure 1	: Conceptual Paradigm	 	\n 	\n 	Figure 1 shows the conceptual 	paradigm in developing an Electronic Document 	\nManagement System. Those who	 will	 access the website will be directed to the server 	\nwhich is connected to the database locally and all the data provided in the file system \nwill  be  viewed.  With  this,  all 	operati	on  will  be  made  easy  from  the  user  up  until  the 	\nadministrator’s side.	 	\n \nScope and Limitations of the project	  	\n 	The EDMS will be intended to the users to upload and inquire for manuscripts. 	\nIt will have the ability to search for keyword(s) inside the 	manuscript and return the title 	\nand abstract containing the keyword(s). The users of the system can be anybody as \nlong  as  registered  in  the  website.  All  details  on  the  website  will  be  provided  by  the \nadministrator on the server side.	 	\n 	The users must 	have a	n account in the website in order to search for research 	\nmaterials. 	The EDMS will employ a search	-engine style of searching for not only exact 	\nmatches but for relevant documents as well. 	Only the title and abstract will be provided 	\nto  the  users,  obtaining 	the  whole  manuscript  will  need  to  have  the  author’s 	\nauthorization.  There  will  be  no  downloading  involved  during  the  whole  process,  all \nmanuscripts or research material must be claimed at the CMU Research office along \nwith the authorization of the author.	 The hard copy of the manuscript will be provided\n\n4 	\n \nwith  a 	barcode;	 the  barcode  will  be	 scanned  by  a  barcode  scanner 	in  order  to 	\ndetermine if the manuscript is being barrowed or is within the Research office.	 On the 	\nuploading  of  manuscripts,  the  student  must  b	e  a  bona  fide  student  of  Central 	\nMindanao  University  and  must  have  completed  all  the  requirements  needed. 	When 	\nuploading the manuscript, the EDMS will automatically assign categories and tags for \nlesser human error.	 	\n 	Statistical  data  will  also  be  displayed	 by  the  web	-application,  this  will  include 	\nstatistical data of student’s course, college, study, and field.	 	\nThe student’s account will b	e coming from the existing data	base	 to access the 	\nwebsite. The existing database will be used by the researcher to develop the EDMS.	 	\nThe  manuscript’s  must  be  in  portable  document  format(PDF)  in  order  for  it  to 	\nbe uploaded.	 Checking of manuscript content for plagiarism will not be included i	n this 	\nstudy.\n\n5 	\n 	\nCHAPTER II	 	\nREVIEW OF RELATED LITERATURE	 	\n  	\nIn  common  language  the  word  document  usually  means  a  container  of 	\ninformation (usually on paper) containing written or drawn information for a particular \npurpose in structured way. Traditionally, a	 document is a piece of paper or a collection 	\nof papers, for instance, a memo, a letter, a mission statement or a customer invoice. \nCentral  to  the  idea  of  a  document  is  usually  that  it  can  be  easily  transferred,  stored \nand  handled  as  a  unit.  Over  the  last 	decade,  the  term  document  has  undergone  a 	\nradical  change  in  definition.  This  change  is partly  due  to  IT.  Thus  a  large  part  of  the \ndocuments handled in today’s business world are stored as individual computer files \nand  are  treaded  as  units  by  the  operating 	and  email  system	 (Life  Cycle  Document 	\nManagement System for Construction, n.d.)	 	\nWeb  application  usability  is  an  evolving  issue.  As  we  learn  more  and  more 	\nabout how our users interact with web application, how our users retrieve i	nformation 	\nand  use  it,  what  our  users  anticipate  within  their  realm  of  experiences,  we  can \niteratively improve our design and implementation	 (Wang, 2006)	. 	\nA  portal is a  system  that  serves  as  a  centralized  place  for accessing  d	ifferent 	\nresources in the Web (Atlantic Webfitters, 2014). It gathers information from different \nsources and put it all together in a single place which can help in accessing information \nby  several  users.  It  provides  the  users  with  a  single  point  of  conten	t,  data,  and 	\nservices. It can be personalized depending on the role of the user in the organization \n(Eldrandaly, 2009). There are different types of portal: general, community, horizontal, \nvertical,  enterprise,  personal,  and  niche.  Community  Portal  is  a  sy	stem  where  the 	\nusers are of same group of interests (Tatnall, 2005). 	 	\nElectronic document management solutions are designed to organize business 	\nfiles  and  records  digitally,  whether  they  started  out  in  paper form  or were  generated \nby  software  applications.	 Paper  files  are  first  converted  to  electronic  format  by 	\nscanning.  This  provides  a  more  compact  means  of  storage,  universal  access  for \nretrieval, and higher levels of data security and privacy	 (Easy Document Management: 	\nA Guide to B	enefits, Features, and Selection, 2011)	.\n\n6 	\n 	\nCodeigniter Development is one of the best PHP framework in web Application 	\nDevelopment. If a developer wished to develop an application in a better way, then the \nonly  option  is  web  development  with  framework.  As  compared  to  the  other \nframeworks,  Codeignit	er  Development  is  fast  and  reliable.  Its  time  and  speed  are 	\nsignificant.  The  developer  can  modify  (software)  for  use  on  a  different  machine  or \nplatform  for  existing  codes  by  using  PHP  framework.  PHP  server  side  scripting \nlanguage  is  very  useful,  In  PHP  sof	tware  development,  PHP  programming  or  PHP 	\napplication  development  or  outsourcing  PHP  is  used 	(What  is  Codeigniter  and  its 	\nadvantages, 2014)	. 	\nThere  are  a  lot  of  benefits  the  codeigniter framework can  offer. Aside from  its 	\nfast, 	reliable, lightweight and more capability. PHP helps in fixing errors on the system 	\neasily.  Through  this  framework,  developer  can  achieve  the  desired  specification  on \nthe developed system. Codeigniter Development can extend on PHP coding to get the \nspecifi	c functions through frameworks. In web Development, many features are almost 	\nthe  same  so  that  can  describe  the  same  code  in  different  way.  Codeigniter  PHP \nDevelopment is the easiest way to employ a program. It is compatible with most web \nservers,  numerous 	operating  systems  and  platforms.  This  framework  has  an 	\noutstanding  performance  and  it  is  famous  among  developer  especially  on  web \ndeveloping	 (Major  Benefits  of  Using  Codeigniter  PHP  Framework  Development, 	\n2016)	. \nPHP	 is one of 	the most popularly used languages for	 web development	 as well 	\nas	 web application development	. Reasons are 	it has 	Perfect Database Interaction:	  it 	\ncan  exchange  all  sorts  of  information  with  ease.  Another  reason  why	 PHP 	website 	\ndevelopment	 and	 web  developme	nt is  admired  by  developers  is  that	 PHP	 programs 	\nare free. Also, the database connectivity is less expensive as compared to that of other \nprograms  such  as  ASP  and  a  Microsoft  product  that  needs  to  be  purchased. \nHowever,	 web development with PHP	 through MyS	QL is free to use.	 PHP	 has also an 	\nupper hand when it comes to speed. This is mainly because, the	 PHP	 code runs faster 	\nas it runs in its own memory space	 (How is PHP used in Web Development, n.d.)	.\n\n7 	\n 	\nCHAPTER III	 	\nTECHNICAL 	BACKGROUND	 	\n \n HTML	 	\n 	Hypertext Mark	-up Language (	HTML) is a computer language devised to allow 	\nwebsite  creation.  These  websites  can  then  be  viewed  by  anyone  else  connected  to \nthe  internet.  It  is  relatively  easy  to  learn,  with  the  basics  being  accessible  to  m	ost 	\npeople in one session and it is quite powerful in what it allows the developer to create. \nIn  developing  a  website  HTML  is  handy.  HTML  codes  are  also  accessible  when  it \ncomes  to  the  coding  process  because  it  can  be  edited  through  Sublime  Text, \nProgramme	rs  Notepad  or  just  simply  a  notepad  editor.  Aside  that  it  helps  on  giving 	\nfunctionalities  on  the  program,  it  is  also  one  of  the  reason  why  designing  became \neasier 	(Shannon, 2012)	. 	\nPHP	 	 	\n 	PHP  Hypertext  Preprocessor  (PHP)  is  a 	widely	-used  open  source  general	-	\npurpose scripting language that is especially suited for web development and can be \nembedded  into  HTML.  PHP  is  also  a  powerful  tool  in  developing  an  interactive  and \ndynamic web page. The code developed in PHP can be executed	 on server and the 	\nresult  is  turned  to  the  browser  as  plain  HTML.  There  are  a  lot  of  things  that  PHP  is \ncapable of doing such as generating dynamic page content, collecting and encrypting \ndata and can be used to control user	-access	 (W	hat is PHP?, n.d.)	. 	\nCodeigniter	 	\n 	CodeIgniter	 comes in the Model	-View	-Controller (MVC) framework. This helps 	\nin changing 	various innovative and descriptive concepts that the users may come up 	\nwith. By usi	ng this framework,	 those concepts	 can be changed	 to actual applications. 	\nAs a developer, PHP codeigniter is	 significant for	 its simplicity	 and effective	ness	. The 	\nbiggest benefit of using CodeIgniter is that 	it can create web solutions t	hat offer a level 	\nof  proficiency	.  This  way, 	it  also 	provide	s effecti	ve  services  to  users.  Such  all	-round 	\nbenefits  are  rarely  found  in  other  frameworks.	 The  quality  of  libraries  that 	can 	be 	\naccess	ed in	 codeigniter framework development is so rich that 	it will meet all needed\n\n8 	\n \nfunctionalities  in  developing  a  system  such  as  up	loads,  cart  and  many  more	 (The 	\nbenefits of using CodeIgniter for web development, 2016)	. 	\nCSS	 	\n 	Cascading Style S	heet (CSS) is a Web page derived from multiple sources with 	\na defined order of precedence where the definitio	ns of 	any style element	. CSS saves 	\na  lot  of  work.  It  can  control  the  layout  of  multiple  pages  all  at  once.  With  the  use 	of 	\nCSS, it can change the layout of the whole H	TML design. It can also be used 	to define 	\nstyles for web pages, including the design, layout an	d variations in display for different 	\ndevices  and  screen  sizes.	 CSS  gives  more  control  over  the  appearance  of  a  Web 	\npage to the page creator than to the browser designer or the viewer.	 (Rouse, n.d.)	 	\nMySQL	 	\n 	MySQL  is  the  world\'s 	most  popular  open  source  database.  With  its  proven 	\nperf	ormance, reliability and usability.	 MySQL has become the leading database choice 	\nfor  web	-based 	applications	. Oracle  drives  MySQL  innovation,  delivering  new 	\ncapabilities to power next generation web, 	cloud, mobile and embedded applications.	 	\nUsing MySQL lets the system access and manipulate database easily 	(About MySQL, 	\nn.d.)	. 	\nBootstrap	 	\n 	Bootstrap  makes  front	-end  web  dev	elopment  faster  and  easier.  It  is	 made  for 	\npeople  of  all  skill  levels,  devices  of  all  shapes,  and  projects  of  all  sizes.	 It 	\ncontains	 HTML	- and	 CSS	-based  design  templates	 for	 typography	,  forms,  buttons, 	\nnavigation and other interface components, as well as optional	 JavaScript	 ext	ensions. 	\nWith  Bootstrap, 	developer  could	 get  extensive  and  beautiful  documentation  for 	\ncommon  HTML  elements,  dozens  of  custom  HTML  and  CSS  components,  and \nawesome jQuery plugins	. It gives the ability to easily create responsive designs. It is 	\neasy to use, 	has a responsive features it is also a b	rowser compatible	 (bootstrap, n.d.)	.\n\n9 	\n \nAJAX	 \nAjax  has  a 	method  of  exchanging  data  with  a  server,  and  updating  parts  of  a 	\nweb  page 	– witho	ut  reloading  the  entire  page. 	Ajax  is  used  to  perform	 a  callback, 	\nmaking a quick round trip to and from the server to retrieve and/or save data without \nposting the entire page back to the server.	 Ajax allows to make asynchronous calls to 	\na web server. This allows the client browser to avoid waiting for all d	ata to arrive before 	\nallowing  the  user  to  act  once  more.  Ajax  enabled  applications  will  always  be  more \nresponsive, faster and more user	-friendly.	 Ajax helps improve the speed, performance 	\nand usability of a web application	 (Segue, 20	13)	. 	\nJAVASCRIPT	 	\n 	Java  Script	 is a  programming  language  designed  specifically  for  electronic 	\ndocuments on the World Wide Web. JavaScript programs are embedded within HTML \nto add dynamic 	interactivity to web documents. JavaScript help in giving 	functionality 	\non an HTML file without difficulty in a	 full programming language	. A simple JavaScript 	\nprogram can add interesting interactive functions to a web page. It makes use of the \nuser  interface  mechanisms  already  in  HTML  to  interact  with  users  of  th	e  web 	\ndocument	. JavaScript cannot make 	a netwo	rk connection	 on its own, it 	is run by most 	\nmodern  browsers.  It 	can  be  developed  in  an	 object	-oriented  programming  and 	\nprocedural programming	 approach	 (Machajewski, n.d.)	. 	\nNAVICAT	 	\n Navicat is one of the solution in developing MySQL/MariaDB because it allows 	\nsimultaneous connection to the databases. It provides a	 natural and powerful graphical 	\ninterface  for  database  management,  development,  and  maintenance.	 It  would  be 	\neasier for the	 developer to  change  specific script  since  it  is easy  and fast  to  migrate 	\nall  needed  data. 	Navicat	 is also	 useful	 when	 it comes	 to transferring	 data	 to a database	 	\nbecause	 it supports	 export	ing	 data from tables, views, or query results to formats 	like Excel	, 	\nAccess, CSV,	 Add, modify, and delete records	. It also gives the tools 	need	ed to manage 	data 	\nefficien	tly and ensure a smooth process. Navicat e	stablish	ed	 secure connections through SSH 	\ntunneling  and  SSL  ensure	s every  connection  is  secure	d,  stable,  and 	reliable.  It  s	upport	s 	\ndifferent authentication methods of database ser	vers such as PAM authentication	 (Navicat for 	\nMySQL, n.d.)	.\n\n10	 	\n \nXAMPP	 \nXAMPP stands for Cross	-Platform (X), Apache (A), MariaDB (M), PHP (P) and 	\nPerl (P).	 It is a si	mple, lightweight Apache distribution that makes it extremely easy for 	\ndevelopers  to  create  a  local  web  server  for  testing  and  deployment  purposes. \nEverything  needed  to  set  up  a  web  server 	– server  application  (Apache),  database 	\n(MariaDB), and scripting la	nguage (PHP) 	– is included in an extractable file.	 XAMPP 	\nis  used  for  offline  modification  of  the  system.  Through  connecting  the  database  in \nnavicat, the system can be accessed easily and can be modified 	(Jangid, 2016)	. 	\nBarcode	 	\n 	Barcodes  are  used  in  the  business  process,  procedures  are  automated  to 	\nincrease produ	ctivity and reduce human error. 	Whenever there is a need to accurately 	\nidentify  or  track  something,  bar	-coding  should  be  used.  For example,  in a data entry 	\nwork 	environment, workers may be required to enter an enormous amount of data into 	\na  customer  database  system.  Instead  of  manually  typing  a  customer  identification \nnumber  into  a  database,  if  the  information  is  contained  in  a  barcode,  a  data  entry \noperator  may  s	can  it  in.  This  would  increase  au	tomation  and  reduce  human  error	 	\n(Barcode for Beginners, 2007)	.\n\n11	 	\n 	\nIdentify Objectives	 	\nand Information	 	\nRequirement	 	\n 	\nRequirement Planning	 	\nRAD De	sign Workshop	 	\nWork with Users \nto Design System	 	\n 	\nBuild the 	 	\nSystem	 	\n 	\nIntroduce the	 	\nNew System	 	\n 	\nImplementation	 	\nCHAPTER IV	 	\nMETHODOLOGY	 	\n 	\n 	This  ar	ea  discusses  the  methodology  that	 will  be  used  in  designing  the 	\nElectronic  Document  Management 	System  of  Central  Mindanao  University’s 	\nResearch Office.	 	\n \nDevelopment Methodology	 	\n \n \n \n \n \n 	 	\n 	\nFigure 3: 	The Rapid Application Development diagram	 	\n 	 	 	\n 	The	 Rapid Application Development	 (RAD)	 model is based on prototyping and 	\niterative  development  with  no  specific  planning  involved.  The  process  of  writing 	the 	\nsoftware itself involves the planning required for developing the product.	 	\nRAD	 focuses on gathering customer requirements through workshops or focus 	\ngroups, early testing of the prototypes by the customer using iterative concept, reuse \nof the existing 	prototypes (components), continuous integration and rapid delivery.	 	\nRAD is also a	 software development methodology that uses minimal planning 	\nin  favor  of  rapid  prototyping.  A  prototype  is  a  working  model  that  is  functionally \nequivalent to a component of th	e product.\n\n12	 	\n \nRequirements Planning	 	\nThe  developer  will  plan  the  whole  duration  in  developing  the  system.  From 	\ngathering  requirements,  coding  process,  system  test,  alpha  test,  bug  fixes, \nimprovements, final fixes and lastly the deployment.	 	\nThe  developer  will  do  some  data  gathering  through  Interviews.  In  the 	\nrequirements  planning  phase,  the  developer  will  conduct  interviews  with  the  staff  of \nCMU 	– Research office. After the interview and discussion, objectives will be identified 	\nand  the  infor	mation  needed  will  be  taken. 	The  developer 	will  do	 some  research  on 	\nwhat  type  of  system  should  be  used  in  order  to  help  enhance  the  whole  process  in \nuploading  and  searching  on  the  organization	. An  electronic  document  management 	\nsystem will be developed bas	ed on the interview.	  	\n 	CMU	-Research  office	 current  system  are  done  manuall	y. An  Excel	 database 	\nwas  involved  in  the  current  system  of  the  CMU	-Research  Office	.  On  the  current 	\nsystem  of  the  CMU	-Research  office	,  the  user  must  go  to  their  building  in  order  to 	\nsubmit their manuscript, also researchers must also go to the research office to look \nfor research materials therefore  research personnel’s 	will  try  to  find  the  materials o	n 	\nthe  file  to  look  for  the  topic	.  Although  the  process  is  that  simple,  it  would  be  ti	me 	\nconsuming for the 	personnel to look for the topic 	without assurance that the 	research 	\nis available. 	 	\nOn the design system, the user will register their account to be able to 	search 	\nfor  research  materials  online	.  Once  registered,  all  available 	manuscript	 titles  and 	\nabstract	 will be viewed. 	In uploading the manuscript, the student will need to use the 	\ncredentials stored in the existing database	. It will be verified by the server 	if the student 	\nhas completed all the requirement prior to the submission of ma	nuscript	. If 	the student 	\nhas not yet completed the requirements the system will mark the uploaded manuscript \n“In  progress”	.  If  the 	student  has  completed  the  requirements  the  system  will  then 	\nprovide the student with Research Number and will be mark with “O	K”.	 	\n 	The  designed  system  provides  convenience  to  the  user  because  they  will  no 	\nlonger be inquiring at the CMU	-Research office	 just to 	submit their manuscript also the 	\nresearch office personnel will no longer have to look over a lot of paper to look for the	 	\nresearch  material  needed.	 Unlike  the  current  system  where  they  have  to  personally\n\n13	 	\n \nsearch	 thus  consuming	 time	. This  is one  of  the  reasons  why  the  designed  system  is 	\nmuch helpful and convenient on the 	CMU	-Research office personnel.	 	\nUser Design	 	\n During  this 	phase,  the  developer  will  creat	e a  prototype  that  represent  all 	\nsystem process, inputs and outputs on the EDMS. As for the design of the system, the \ndevelo	per  will  use	 Bootstrap,  HTML,  CSS  and  JS  framework  for  it  to  be  responsive 	\nwhich can be viewed in any end devices like smartph	ones and tablets. The database 	\nsystem  used  in  the  project  will	 be	 MySQL  and  SQL  server  together  with  Navicat 	\nMySQL.  Navicat  is  a  software  for 	database  management.  In  order  to  access  the 	\ndatabase, the developer will use Codeigniter for it to function according to its process.	 	\nIn order to elaborate the whole process of the developed system, the developer 	\nwill create a context diagram. The context 	diagram will show that the user will input its 	\ncredentials.  The  administrator will then  manage  the  transactions made  by  the  online \nsystem. 	 	\n 	In  order  to  identify  the  functional features  that  will  be  added  to  the  developed	 	\nsystem,  a use  case  diagram 	will be	 designed.  All  actions  that the user can  do  in  the 	\nweb	-based  application 	will  be	 shown  in  the  figure.  The  user  of  the  system 	will	 be 	\nresearchers	, CMU	-Research office	 and 	the student	s of CMU.	 	\nThe  developer	 will  conduct  an  interview  and  will  mak	e  some  resear	ches  with 	\nCentral  Mindanao  University	-Research  office  personnel	 	and  management. 	\nInformation about the organization’s needs 	will be	 taken. After the conducted research, 	\nthe  developer	 will  design  a  system  that  will	 meet  the organization’s needs.  An  entity 	\nrelationship diagram 	will be	 created to represent the flow	. 	\n 	A  data  di	ctionar	y will  show	 the  description  of  the  fields  used  in  the  system.  It 	\nwill show	 what field and type of data 	will be	 used. 	 	\nConstruction	 	\n Durin	g  the 	development  of  the  system,  the  developer  will  gather  some 	\ninformation on what is best to use in developing a web	-based system. With these, the 	\ndeveloper  will  use  C	odeigniter  as  its  framework.  The  system  will  be  developed  with\n\n14	 	\n \nPHP, HTML, CSS and other	 programming languages that is necessary in fulfilling the 	\nneeds of the	 system. Also, with the use of C	odeigniter the development stage will be 	\nmade easier. With the help of its built	-in libraries and other functionalities such as add 	\nto cart, upload and c	onstructors. The developer will use procedural and object oriented 	\nprogramming approach on the coding process. There are also different structures that \nwill use like Statements (if) and Loop (foreach) in conditioning the codes.  	 	\n 	 In  developing  the	 system	 there  are  tools  that  will  be	 used.    For  the  user 	\ninterface,  the  developer 	will  use	 HTM	L,  CSS  and  bootstrap.  HTML  provides  the 	\ngraphical  interface  of  the  system  such  as  buttons,  inputs,  checkbox, 	attributes	 and 	\nmany more. CSS was used 	to quickly create lay	outs, and troubleshoot any problems 	\nwhen designing a website. Bootstrap 	will be use	 for the system to be responsive. For 	\nthe back end of the system, the developer 	will use	 PHP, Codeigniter Framework and 	\nAjax. 	PHP generates dynamic page content and it also allows to store and fetch data 	\non the database. 	Co	deigniter will help the developer 	develop a system in a simple way 	\nwith the help of its built	-in functions and constructors. 	Ajax 	will be use	 for the system 	\nto	 be more responsive, faster and more user	-friendly. Other tools such as Navicat and 	\nXAMPP 	will	 also	 be use	d for connectivity and access to the database used.	 	\nSoftware Requirements	 	\n 	Software  requirements  in  building  the  system  will  be  browsers  like  Google 	\nChrome, Firefox, Safari, Internet Explorer and Opera Mini. Also, Sublime Text Editor, \nFileZilla (version 3.20.1 or later), Navicat (version 10.0.6 or later). 	 	\nHardware Requirements	 	\n 	The minimum requirements in developing the system are at least Intel Pentium 	\n4  or  newer  processor  that  support  SSE2  and  512MB  of  Random  Access  Memory \n(RAM).	  	\nImplementation	 	\nAs soon as the aspects on	 the systems are built and refined, the new systems 	\nor par	t of systems are tested and then introduced to the organization. Because RAD 	\ncan be used to create new ecommerce applications for which there is no old system, \nthere  is  often  no  need  to  run  the  old  and  new  systems  in  parallel  before \nimplementation.\n\n15	 	\n \nTesting	 	\n 	During  the  testing  phase  of  the  system,  the  developer 	will  conduct	 an  Alpha 	\nand  Beta  testing.	 An  alpha  test  is  a  preliminary  software  field  test  carried  out  by 	the 	\ndeveloper 	in order to find bugs that were not found previously through other tests. The 	\nmain purpose of alpha testing is to refine t	he software product by finding and fixing 	the 	\nbugs that were not discovered through previous tests	 (Alpha Test, n.d.)	. Alpha testing 	\nwill be	 done by the developer to test whether all features are functionally capable. The 	\ndeveloper 	will also explore	 capabilities of the whole system. It is usually done during 	\nthe whole process of developing the system.	 A beta testing is when	 applications are 	\nsu	bjected to real world testing by the intended 	user	 for the 	website	. In the Beta testing, 	\nother  personnel  like  CMU  students 	will	 test  the  system.  Users  who  are  new  to  the 	\nsystem will be using it and will determine if the system is	 suitable for the organizat	ion. 	\nBeta testing is done in order to know if the system is useful to the organization. In this \ntest, the developer will know the features on the system that need improvements.	 	\nSoftware Requirements	 	\n 	In  the  implementation  phase,  the  minimum  software  requirements  are  web 	\nbrowsers such as Google Chrome (version 3.0.195 or later), Mozilla Firefox (version \n54.0.1  or  later),  Opera  Mini  (version  11.52),  Safari  (version  4.0.3  for  Mac  OS  and \nversion 4.0 for Wi	ndows X or later), Internet Explorer Edge (version 21.10547 or later). 	 	\n Hardware Requirement	 	\n 	For  the  hardware  minimum  requirements  are  internet  connected  end  devices 	\nsuch as tablets and smartphones capable to open the mentioned browsers.	 A barcode 	\nprinte	r and a barcode scanner using linear barcode (Code 128).	  	\nOperating System	 	\n 	As  for  the  operating  system  the  website  can  be  opened  through  mobile  or 	\ndesktop. For desktop, it must be at least a Windows XP or later. As for the mobile, it \nmust be at least a 	gingerbread 2.3.7 for android and IOS 8.', '2018-06-28 06:56:09', '2018-06-28 06:56:09');
